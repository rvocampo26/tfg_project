In this Specialization, you will learn the fundamentals of both of these purposes of accounting.  More specifically, you will understand the financial statements that managers create, and be able to interpret and analyze these statements to assess the financial position of the organization.  You will also identify and understand the nature, purpose, and importance of different types of decision-useful accounting information, and use analytical tools and techniques to use this information to make business decisions.  Via the capstone, you will apply these fundamentals via the lens of a new business, creating a business plan, forecasts and budgets, and anticipated information needs for decisions made by you as owner and manager, your employees, and external parties such as future shareholders, creditors, and other constituents.

There is a significant need to provide a deep skillset to learners who have significant potential to change this system towards equity. Reducing racial and ethnic health disparities is core to the mission of public health. The healthcare delivery system contributes to these disparities in unique and complex ways.In this MOOC series, we will learn about the sociological contributions and historical backdrop of why racial inequities exist in healthcare. We will also critically analyze the various causes of racial inequities in healthcare. And lastly, we will go through approaches to achieving equity in healthcare.Applied Learning ProjectThere is one peer-reviewed assignment in Week 3 of every course, summarized below:Course 1: learners will select a country, U.S. state, city or town and explore its health status by creating a \"health profile,\" introducing learners to looking into health-related literature and help develop the skills necessary to recognize racial disparities in healthcare.Course 2: learners will select a country or U.S. state and explore the healthcare structure by creating a \"healthcare structure profile,\" teaching learners to gather factual statements about healthcare systems and develop the skills necessary to analyze the causes of racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare that stem from the system structure.Course 3: learners will select a country or U.S. state and create an intervention to address a specific racial/ethnic disparity in healthcare, allowing them to think through the possible interventions and solutions to address a specific disparity in healthcare.",

This specialization focuses on the Prescriptive Analytics (the final pillar).  This specialization will review basic predictive modeling techniques that can be used to estimate values of relevant parameters, and then use optimization and simulation techniques to formulate decisions based on these parameter values and situational constraints. The specialization will teach how to model and solve decision-making problems using predictive models, linear optimization, and simulation methods.

        "description": "This specialization targets learners who seek to understand the opportunities that data and analytics present for their organization and those interested in the value of and implications for data as an asset to their organization. Individuals who manage data and make decisions about how data can be leveraged in their organization will find this specialization of particular value.Businesses run on data, and data offers little value without analytics. The ability to process data to make predictions about the behavior of individuals or markets, to diagnose systems or situations, or to prescribe actions for people or processes drives business today. Increasingly many businesses are striving to become \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata-driven\u00e2\u0080\u009d, proactively relying more on cold hard information and sophisticated algorithms than upon the gut instinct or slow reactions of humans.In this information age, the value of data as a business asset is essential. Organizations must creatively consider and implement new ways to generate economic benefits from the wide array of information assets available. Unfortunately, information frequently is under-appreciated and underutilized. Besides, accounting practices fail to recognize the financial value of information, and traditional asset management practices fail to recognize information as an asset to be managed with earnest discipline. This has led to a business culture of complacence, and the inability for organizations to leverage available information assets.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will work on cases in every course and the specialization will culminate with a project capstone that will embrace the knowledge acquired in the courses taken in this specialization. The project capstone will consist of 4 weeks worth of activities that lead to a final project report and presentation that will be evaluated by classmates in peer review assignments following a very detailed rubric to make sure students receive meaningful feedback on their submission.

Anti-Racism II builds on the basics introduced in the first course and explores historical and linguistic constructions of race and racism in the United States and the theory of intersectionality. The second course also asks learners to apply its content to cultural contexts outside of the US, and it culminates in an interview project aimed at deepening conversational nuance when learners engage with the topics of race and racism with family, friends, colleagues, or peers. Anti-Racism III then puts the theory introduced in the first two courses into practice. Learners will create a plan for practicing anti-racism and develop a project for community outreach and engagement.Applied Learning ProjectLearn, speak, act! The assignments and projects in Anti-Racism guide you from learning the basics of talking about race and racism to guiding a more nuanced and historically-informed conversation about identity in your cultural context.

Through four complete courses (From Concept to Data Analysis; Techniques and Models; Mixture Models; Time Series Analysis) and a culminating project, you will cover Bayesian methods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as conjugate models, MCMC, mixture models, and dynamic linear modeling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which will provide you with the skills necessary to perform analysis, engage in forecasting, and create statistical models using real-world data.Applied Learning ProjectThis Specialization trains the learner in the Bayesian approach to statistics, starting with the concept of probability all the way to the more complex concepts such as dynamic linear modeling. You will learn about the philosophy of the Bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common types of data, and then dive deeper into the analysis of time series data.The courses in this specialization combine lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience, while the culminating project is an opportunity for the learner to demonstrate a wide range of skills and knowledge in Bayesian statistics and to apply what you know to real-world data. You will review essential concepts in Bayesian statistics, learn and practice data analysis using R (an open-source, freely available statistical package), perform a complex data analysis on a real dataset, and compose a report on your methods and results.",

This Specialization explores how science investigates this unusual form of locomotion.\u00c2\u00a0We have developed a Specialization that explores how science investigates this unusual form of locomotion. We start our investigation by looking at the mechanics of upright walking in humans and comparing that to bipedal locomotion in large birds, bears, and apes.We journey back millions of years into the human fossil record in an effort to understand how and why upright walking evolved. Around our first birthday, each of us learned how to walk, but how does this happen? With bipedalism came costly trade-offs as well\u00e2\u0080\u0093 in this course, we examine these aches and pains as byproducts of our evolutionary history.Applied Learning ProjectLearners are invited to reflect on the ideas and evidence presented in lectures and readings through course discussions and individual writing prompts. Additionally, learners are prompted to discuss their learning journey with friends or family members as a means of reflection and synthesis. This course will take an intentionally interdisciplinary approach to studying how and why humans move bipedally. You will be exposed to anthropology, biomechanics, anatomy, evolution and paleontology to explore something deeply human: upright walking.",

It provides you with the necessary tools so that you are able to understand the brand behavior, understand the language of a brand and learn about the rational and emotional elements behind brands.  It also attempts to make you understand the language of images. The amount of audiovisual content we receive today makes it hard for brands to break through that noise. It ends up teaching how to understand branding efforts in the context of customer experience.We must think in a strategic manner when creating brands. Branding is about co-creation and conversation between the audiences, customers and users. What is relevant is how people out there perceive and live the brand. Brands are the story, the personality and the culture of an organization; the intangible elements that form it. Applied Learning ProjectAt the end of each MOOC, you will find a capstone project. You will have the opportunity to put into practice everything learned during the course. First, you must develop a brand strategy and identity for a restaurant in Menorca. In addition, you will have to create a content strategy plan, which includes the brand strategy and target audience, the story behind it, the platforms what you will use to communicate this message and finally the concept and treatment of this story. You will also have to produce a creative pitch for the rebranding of an existing brand; you will have to build it up as if you were going to expose this pitch to the client, the brand itself. Finally, you will deliver a customer journey to understand the stages of the interaction of the brand department with the product or service the brand provides to the customers.",

Developed at Johns Hopkins University and led by top-ranked Hopkins faculty and\ncancer experts, this specialization on Cancer Biology focuses on the basics of cancer biology,\nhow cancer metastasis occurs, and specifically, screening guidelines for prostate cancer, the\nmost common cancer in American men.\nThis specialization starts with an Introduction to the Biology of Cancer, introduces the molecular\nbiology of cancer and the biologic hallmarks of cancer. The course also describes the risk\nfactors for the major cancers worldwide, including lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer,\nprostate cancer, liver cancer, and stomach cancer. Experts at Johns Hopkins University explain\nhow cancer is staged, the major ways cancer is found by imaging, and how the major cancers\nare treated.\nThe specialization takes a deeper dive in Understanding Cancer Metastasis, explaining how\ncancer spreads or metastasizes. This course will describe the major theories of metastasis and\nthen describe the biology behind the steps in metastasis. The course also describes the major\norgans targeted by metastasis and describes how metastases harm the patient.\nLastly, it focuses on Understanding Prostate Cancer, providing you with the tools to examine the\nincidence of prostate cancer, including risk factors, stages, and treatments at each stage.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will be able to identify the major types of cancer worldwide, describe how genes contribute to the risk and growth of cancer, and describe the ten cellular hallmarks of cancer. Learners will also describe uncontrolled cell division as well as mutation, neoangiogenesis and their roles in tumor formation. From this learners will be introduced to prostate cancer and be able to list the risk factors. Specifically, you will examine how prostate cancer is found, diagnosed, staged, and treated.",

Or maybe you already have some experience using SQL to query smaller-scale data with relational databases. Either way, if you are interested in gaining the skills necessary to query big data with modern distributed SQL engines, this Specialization is for you.Most courses that teach SQL focus on traditional relational databases, but today, more and more of the data that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being generated is too big to be stored there, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing too quickly to be efficiently stored in commercial data warehouses. Instead, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly stored in distributed clusters and cloud storage. These data stores are cost-efficient and infinitely scalable.To query these huge datasets in clusters and cloud storage, you need a newer breed of SQL engine: distributed query engines, like Hive, Impala, Presto, and Drill. These are open source SQL engines capable of querying enormous datasets. This Specialization focuses on Hive and Impala, the most widely deployed of these query engines.This Specialization is designed to provide excellent preparation for the Cloudera Certified Associate (CCA) Data AnalystOpens in a new tab certification exam. You can earn this certification credential by taking a hands-on practical exam using the same SQL engines that this Specialization teaches\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hive and Impala.Applied Learning ProjectEach course in this Specialization includes a hands-on, peer-graded assignment.

Starting with the neuroanatomy of the brain, it then moves into principles of neuroimaging, including experimental design in neuroimaging, functional connectivity MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and spectroscopy imaging.The specialization then continues with two courses that focus on Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, one of the most widely used techniques for investigating the living, functioning human brain as people perform tasks and experience mental states, and a convergence point for multidisciplinary work. To conclude, the specialization moves into implementation of neurohacking using the R programming language, with the associated packages to perform data manipulation, processing, and analysis of neuroimaging data, using publicly available structural MRI.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will go from fMRI data design, structure and acquisition to using the R programming language (https://cran.r-project.org/) and its associated package to perform manipulation, processing, and analysis of neuroimaging data. Specifically, you will learn how to read/write images of the brain in NIfTI format, visualize and explore these images, perform inhomogeneity correction, brain extraction, and image registration (within a subject and to a template).",

Currently, this is taken advantage of by the most valuable companies in Silicon Valley, the most powerful governmental agencies, and the most influential social movements. What they have in common is that they use computational tools to understand, and ultimately influence human behavior and social dynamics. An increasing part of human interaction leaves a massive digital footprint behind. Studying it allows us to gain unprecedented insights into what society is and how it works, including its intricate social networks that had long been obscure. Computational power allows us to detect hidden patterns through analytical tools like machine learning and to natural language processing. Finally, computer simulations enable us to explore hypothetical situations that may not even exist in reality, but that we would like to exist: a better world. This specialization serves as a multidisciplinary, multi-perspective, and multi-method guide on how to better understand society and human behavior with modern research tools. This specialization gives you easy access to some of the exciting new  possibilities of how to study society and human behavior. It is the  first online specialization collectively taught by Professors from all  10 University of California campusesOpens in a new tab.

        "description": "For an increasing number of established companies, creating new business opportunities within the company is an imperative for success. Maturing technologies and aging product portfolios are requiring companies to create, develop, and sustain innovative new businesses. The Corporate Entrepreneurship Specialization is designed for those interested in learning how to innovate and apply entrepreneurship principles in the corporate setting. Learners will develop knowledge on how to navigate the barriers to creating, developing, and sustaining innovative new businesses or initiatives within existing companies. These new activities rarely fit neatly within well-established systems, processes, and cultures. Learners will develop the skills, and learn the tools and best practices, for identifying and developing the entrepreneurial opportunities, building business models, creating strategies for leading innovation, and financing innovation. These four topics comprise the four courses of the Corporate Entrepreneurship Specialization, along with a final project.The Corporate Entrepreneurship Specialization is for individuals who are charged and/or inspired to develop and lead new businesses within established companies. It's specifically designed for junior- and middle-managers with the the opportunity, or responsibility, to start new businesses or initiatives within their company or division, in any industry, and in any country. Applied Learning ProjectThe course projects challenge learners to apply the strategies, tactics, and tools learned in the course to examine leading companies or the learner's own company. With this action-oriented approach, learners can quickly develop and apply lessons learned to develop or reclaim their company's innovation prowess. ",

When you know the costs of your products, you will make better pricing decisions and you can better choose which products to offer. When you know the costs of your departments, you can better detect inefficiencies and you can better incentivize your employees.In this Specialization, you will learn the fundamentals of cost accounting. Three courses cover the basics of cost accounting. We will start with an introduction to product costing. How can you figure out the costs of your individual products? Next, we will discuss how to connect cost information with revenue information to calculate profits and profitability. Finally, we focus on how to use the information provided by cost accounting systems to optimize your business decisions.We have created the courses of this Specialization for interdisciplinary young professionals seeking to develop cost accounting skills. At the same time, the courses can help students in management and business administration to repeat the content of their introductory cost accounting course.Applied Learning ProjectThis specialization is structured along with lecture videos and uses readings as well as a series of quizzes and interactive learning elements to help learners gain an understanding of the basics of Cost Accounting. The specialization also applies practical learning elements like building an Excel spreadsheet to determine cost functions and includes numerous illustrative examples from a variety of industries. The coursework teaches learners to plan, control, monitor, and document cost information. From product and service costing, to profit and loss calculation, and leveraging of cost information as the basis for decision-making, the specialization provides a sound foundation to cost accounting.",

However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice.\u00c2\u00a0To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview. We invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs.

You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco 1000 times faster than the shortest path algorithms you learn in the standard Algorithms 101 course!

Being able to use this data provides huge opportunities and to turn these opportunities into reality, people need to use data to solve problems. This Specialization, in collaboration with Tableau, is intended for newcomers to data visualization with no prior experience using Tableau. We leverage Tableau's library of resources to demonstrate best practices for data visualization and data storytelling. You will view examples from real world business cases and journalistic examples from leading media companies. By the end of this specialization, you will be able to generate powerful reports and dashboards that will help people make decisions and take action based on their business data. You will use Tableau to create high-impact visualizations of common data analyses to help you see and understand your data. You will apply predicative analytics to improve business decision making.  The Specialization culminates in a Capstone Project in which you will use sample data to create visualizations, dashboards, and data models to prepare a presentation to the executive leadership of a fictional company.

What should you put on your sandwich? What song should you listen to on the way to work? These may seem like tiny decisions, but they're decisions nonetheless. Bigger decisions demand bigger solutions and its up to you to find them. Decision-making isn't just making the right choice: It's also the ability to solve problems and think creatively applied directly to real situations. These are all skills that you can develop, and this course will help you unlock that potential.With the expertise of Dr. Brent Scholar from the ASU College of Integrative Arts and Sciences, the decision-making specialization will put the tools, knowledge and strategies to make effective decisions directly into your hands.

One needs to be fluent in it to work in many fields including data science, machine learning, and software engineering (it is not a coincidence that math puzzles are often used for interviews). We introduce you to this language through a fun try-this-before-we-explain-everything approach: first you solve many interactive puzzles that are carefully designed specifically for this online specialization, and then we explain how to solve the puzzles, and introduce important ideas along the way. We believe that this way, you will get a deeper understanding and will better appreciate the beauty of the underlying ideas (not to mention the self confidence that you gain if you invent these ideas on your own!). To bring your experience closer to IT-applications, we incorporate programming examples, problems, and projects in the specialization.

Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces that hold atoms and molecules together, which are the building blocks of any materials.In four courses, you will learn the foundations of electrodynamics starting from the nature of electrical force up to the level of in-depth solutions of Maxwell equations. We will walk you through vector calculus, concepts of field, flux and circulation, electrostatics, and magnetostatics as well as electrodynamics. By the end of this Specialization you will understand four beautiful equations organized by Maxwell in a full picture. Special relativity will be covered as well to grasp the idea that magnetism is a relativistic effect of electricity. The approach taken in this Specialization complements traditional approaches, covering a fairly complete treatment of the physics of electricity and magnetism, and adds Feynman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique and vital approach of grasping a whole picture of the physical universe. In addition, this Specialization uniquely bridges the gap between the knowledge of electrodynamics and its practical applications to research in materials science, information technology, electrical engineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, energy storage, energy harvesting, and other materials related fields. Applied Learning ProjectThe purpose behind this particular project is learning to apply the concepts of Electrodynamics. Therefore, we ask you to apply the equations and concepts you learned designing or improving a process relating to your own work or a topic you are interested in.You will have a chance to write a short paper on any research topic that uses the knowledge you learned in this Specialization. Through this project, you will learn hands on how to apply the electrodynamics in your current or future research.",

The American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) established that the crash most probably was caused by the flight crew's (in)actions. Three teenage girls lost their lives; two in the airplane and another was accidentally run over by a firetruck.The human factor is often cause for accidents. NTSB and others report that more than 50 percent of plane crashes is caused by pilot error (and for road accidents it is even 90 perc.) Correctly designed safety and security critical systems can prevent these errors.After following this course successfully, you are able to develop secure embedded systems that are at the core of these safety and security critical systems. You are even challenged to program your own landing guiding system in our capstone project. If you are interested in building secure embedded systems for the benefit of humanity, this specialization is for you!EIT Digital has chosen 3 MOOC topics of industrial interest, namely: 1) Embedded design and hardware, 2) Security in embedded connectivity and 3) Real-Time systems. These MOOCs show what it takes to program Internet-of-Things systems. We focus on tools used in the modern IoT industry, and we push for a practical learn-by-programming approach in which you are exposed to the actual development in an early stage.We hope to see you soon!Applied Learning ProjectOur project is a practical programming assignment in which the learner combines the knowledge from our three courses. The learner will develop a real embedded IoT system based on the FreeRTOS platform from Wittenstein Ltd. It is a true engineering task in which the learner must apply both their skills and creativity to build a functioning large scale embedded system.",

        "description": "Growing a business needs a dynamic set of skills, ranging from leadership, employee management, strategy, planning, finance, accounting, ethics, accountability, and profitability.Developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, and led by top-ranked Darden faculty, this specialization covers challenges faced by private businesses, when they attempt to grow substantially. It starts with common challenges and human resource issues faced by private business.  It then teaches you essential financial accounting skills for entrepreneurs, such as creating and interpreting cash flow, balance sheet, and income statements to make financial health conclusions.This specialization also presents an exciting new approach to values-driven leadership development in the workplace, in business education, and in life.  In an action oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (GVV), it is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, and we feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively.  It then discusses the emergence of a new story about business, contextualizing it within a societal framework.  Finally, it teaches you to write innovative business plans, by driving meaningful focus, forcing specificity, and bringing linkages between key business drivers to the foreground.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will go from implementing financial accounting applications to an action oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (GVV) to writing innovative business plans, over the course of this specialization.  Specifically, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use journal entries to record transactions and prepare and use t-accounts to summarize transactions recorded during an accounting period, as well as create an explicit view of a company or product strategy in 20 minutes!",

As the title of this specialization suggests, financial decisions by investors, as well as capital deployment by companies, organizations, and governments, have been shifting amid increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance-related concerns.By the end of this specialization, students with basic knowledge of traditional financial products (e.g., stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, commodities) should obtain a solid background on how ESG investing principles originated, and how related governing frameworks, analytical strategies, and investment products are evolving in the financial markets, including a proliferation of various fixed-income instruments and thematic ETFs.Moreover, you'll acquire insights into some of the benefits and drawbacks of Big Data as a complement to fundamental analysis, and how developments in data science, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis algorithms, may be used for actionable accountability.You will further be able to detail why ESG investing remains a work in progress and list some anticipated developments for its future.We look forward to you joining us!For more information about Interactive Brokers, visit https://ibkr.comOpens in a new tabApplied Learning ProjectIntegrate ESG factors when conducting fundamental analyses, offer insights about approaches to sustainable portfolio management construction, and align ESG factors with organizational frameworks such as the UN's SDGs and SASB frameworks.

Causal models allow us to develop further business insights and strategy by controlling the inputs to generate the output we desire.In the third and final course, we explore the role of Judgmental Forecasting, when more quantitative forecasting methods have limitations, and we need to generate further business insights. We will be exploring some structured methodologies to create judgmental business forecasts and explore how Excel can assist us in these judgments. We will bring all these forecasting methods together in a final case study, giving you the opportunity to generate forecasts, which are the inputs to any organisation's planning.Applied Learning ProjectWorking with datasets similar to those typically found in a business, you will use quantitative and qualitative forecasting techniques to generate business forecasts.

This question guides Fandom and Popular Culture in the Digital Age. In our networked and information-saturated world, three vital needs emerge: representing identity in digital media, interrogating the products of culture, and engaging meaningfully with digital communities. This course addresses these needs by inviting you into a space of reflection at the intersection of fandom, popular culture, and digital media. More than at any point in human history, these forces have put at our fingertips the means to create and disseminate ourselves in the world. We will explore the products of popular culture and trace the fan networks that sustain and derive value from them. Along the way, we will train you to recognize relationships between popular culture and the political and commercial forces that shape its publication, distribution, and consumption. This course will equip you with the tools necessary to boost your digital media fluency and define, shape, and evolve your identity as a fan within digital spaces. But ultimately, this is a celebration - a celebration of you and your communities, what you love, and how that love might bring people together to change the world. Together, we can make this a community-driven online resource for our shared endeavor of analyzing and understanding fandom and popular culture.Applied Learning ProjectThe projects across this specialization challenge learners to reflect deeply on their experiences, practice skills of close reading, analysis, and interpretation, and express their fandom in thoughtful and creative ways. Learners will practice digital literacy and professional communication skills through reflecting on their personal fandom in blog-style writing, express their creativity by making something relevant to their fandom, and engage with their fandom directly through online platforms.",

        "description": "The objective of this course is to acquire proficiency with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)s for the purpose of creating prototypes or products for a variety of applications. Although FPGA design can be a complex topic, we will introduce it so that, with a little bit of effort, the basic concepts will be easily learned, while also providing a challenge for the more experienced designer. We will explore complexities, capabilities and trends of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD). Conception, design, implementation, and debugging skills will be practiced. We will learn specifics around embedded IP and processor cores, including tradeoffs between implementing versus acquiring IP. Projects will involve the latest software and FPGA development tools and hardware platforms to help develop a broad perspective of the capabilities of various Programmable SoC solutions. Topics include:Verilog, VHDL, and RTL design for FPGA and CPLD architectures FPGA development tools flow: specify, synthesize, simulate, compile, program and debug Configurable embedded processors and embedded softwareUse of soft-core and hard-core processors and OS optionsFPGA System engineering, software-hardware integration, and testing IP development and incorporating 3rd-party IP The capstone course will give the learner the opportunity to practice and implement the concepts covered by building FPGA systems based on low cost evaluation boards.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will practice building and testing several FPGA projects using industry standard FPGA hardware development tools by applying skills including VHDL and Verilog coding, programmable logic synthesis and simulation, static timing analysis and FPGA device programming.  The culmination of these efforts will be the construction of a configurable softcore processor system on a chip using the DE10-Lite evaluation board.    ",

        "description": "Knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an increasingly sought after skill in industries from agriculture to public health. This Specialization, offered in partnership with ArcGIS developer Esri, will teach the skills you need to successfully use GIS software in a professional setting. You will learn how to analyze your spatial data, use cartography techniques to communicate your results in maps, and collaborate with peers in GIS and GIS-dependent fields. In the final Capstone Project, you will create a professional-quality GIS portfolio piece using a combination of data identification and collection, analytical map development, and spatial analysis techniques.Interested in learning advanced GIS topics? Check out the Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization MasterTrack\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 ProgramOpens in a new tab.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will work through the various course projects to gain experience and skills related to geographic information systems. Each course reviews the concepts in a final project to reinforce your learning. Each course builds on the knowledge of the previous and the Specialization culminates with a capstone where you will design and execute a complete GIS-based analysis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from identifying a concept, question or issue you wish to develop, all the way to final data products and maps that you can add to your portfolio.",

It aims to provide learners with opportunities to understand the complex international setting of global health, the role of important stakeholders and the need for good governance in global health. Learners will be introduced to some of the most important challenges to global health and their implications in global health practice. Learners will discuss the main drivers of global health challenges, including global change and globalisation, and consider issues of inequity surrounding the impact of these challenges.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Learners will explore how the capacity to influence health determinants, status and outcomes cannot be assured through national actions alone because of the intensification of cross-border and trans-border flows of vectors, people, goods, services and ideas. By the end of the specialisation, learners should be able to effectively advocate, to a wide range of audiences, for specific action/s on topical global health challenges and propose evidence-informed measures that could be introduced to mitigate the impacts on health.This specialisation will explore in depth two global health challenges; migration and climate change. The Climate change and health course was developed in collaboration with Imperial College's Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the EnvironmentOpens in a new tab. Applied Learning ProjectIn the Globalisation and health governance course, learners will conduct a literature review to evaluate evidence on a global health challenge (GHC) of their choice. Learners will explore a GHC they find interesting, and learn to critically evaluate evidence on it. In Migration and health, learners will create an infographic on a GHC of their choice to communicate with the public and stakeholders. Public engagement is a key competency in global health and this will help learners distill knowledge from sources and convey complex ideas to a general audience.In Climate change and health, learners will write a policy brief on a GHC of their choice, to communicate research or recommendations to policymakers. At the end of this course learners will submit a Capstone project, which consolidates the three previous projects into a cohesive whole, in which learners critically analyse a GHC using different lenses. We recommend using the same GHC throughout the specialisation.",

        "description": "The Global Disease Masterclass specialisation aims to provide students with an overview of core health challenges and lines of epidemiological research being undertaken, across a range of infectious and non-communicable diseases.The specialisation begins by examining the global distribution of diseases and the major trends that we have seen in the last several decades. Simultaneously, we consider the data that are used to construct such estimates. We then consider the role of social determinants and risk factors in shaping the distribution of disease in populations. For each, the overall aetiology and epidemiological patterns are described and subsequently, the interventions that are available to combat them are considered. Particular \u00e2\u0080\u0098policy issues\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in relation to each disease are examined from multiple angles. Each session comprises lecture content with leaders in the field, practical activities and in-depth interview with subject matter experts. The specialisation will give students a broad understanding of the major global issues in health and an in-depth understanding of some of the most important disease challenges that are being faced today. It will equip public health professionals and researchers with a broad foundation of knowledge on which to build further expertise about global public health.",

        "description": "If you want to learn more about medical cannabis (i.e., marijuana) and hemp-derived CBD, then this specialization is for you! A person who wants to know more about cannabis and CBD might be:A patient or their loved one who wants to understand the potential risks and benefits.A health care provider who wants to communicate with patients about cannabis.Someone who wants to work in the cannabis industry.Why do people want to know more about cannabis? The legalization of cannabis (i.e., marijuana) and the recent federal legalization of\ncannabidiol (CBD) has led to unprecedented access to cannabinoids (e.g. THC and CBD), a projected 60 billion dollar industry (cannabis and hemp) by 2025, and the fastest growing jobs sector in the economy according to recent reports in the media. Despite all of this, there is very little evidence-based information about the health effects of cannabis or about how to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing harm. Parents of children with seizure disorders, veterans with PTSD and chronic pain, cancer patients, and our aging parents deserve better. People WANT evidence-based information about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis products so that they can weigh the pros and cons of cannabis and CBD versus other options. They also want to know how to maximize the positive effects of cannabis while minimizing the side effects. This specialization is designed to provide that information.Applied Learning ProjectAssignments are experiential in nature and designed to provide students with specific skills regardless of their age or their reasons for taking the specialization (to be an educated patient, continuing education for health care providers, or to obtain a job in the industry). Students will engage with dispensaries, healthcare providers, and/or patients on important questions related to the safety and health effects of cannabis and CBD.  For example, students might visit two dispensaries, ask questions about the safety and health effects of products, and compare answers across the dispensaries. Students might also discuss cannabis with their doctor and compare answers. Students will also consolidate learning  with the creation of infographics. Creating evidence-based infographics is not only a great learning tool, it also provides a skill that is highly desirable among job applicants in the cannabis industry and in public health and public policy positions.

        "description": "                  The healthcare tetralogy specialization is intended for anyone interested in healthcare organization as practiced in the United States.  A range of healthcare organizations are discussed (e.g., medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and public health).  The specialization is particularly useful to anyone working in the healthcare industry who either has: 1)  a developing interest in the issues important to the administration of healthcare organization operations; or 2) some expertise, but wishes an overview or refresher of the issues.  However, those who do not work in the healthcare industry, but who interact with healthcare organizations of any type as patients/consumers will also find the specialization informative.  Through the four courses in the specialization, you will cover many aspects of healthcare organization operations including the relationship between healthcare organizations and the health system as well as health care delivery, business process management, and quality improvement within healthcare organizations.  Upon completion of the specialization, those who interact with healthcare organizations as patients/consumers will have a better understanding of the issues involved in the effective administration of healthcare organizations and operations.  Those working in the healthcare industry, upon completion of the specialization, will be better able to contribute to the effective administration of the healthcare organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.      Applied Learning Project                  The capstone project for each course requires learners to critically synthesize the material from the course to create a healthcare organization and communicate/present aspects of that organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations to their learner colleagues.  Each project is presented to learner colleagues via the peer-review feature and each learner evaluates the project of two learner colleagues. The peer-review feature is chosen because each project is presented from the perspective of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of that organization.  One skill required of all CEOs is the ability to present their thinking and conclusions to others and expect evaluation and feedback.  Another skill required of all CEOs is the ability to critically evaluate the presentation, thinking, and conclusions of others.  The format of the communication/presentation is different for each course and reflects communication/presentation strategies of importance to CEOs of healthcare organizations.    ",

Or freshen up your HR knowledge?This specialization provides a robust introduction to the key principles, policies, and practices of human resource management. The specialization begins with a foundational course that considers alternative approaches to managing human resources, provides a background to the U.S. legal context in which employees are hired, fired, rewarded, and managed, and outlines the different reasons that people are motivated to work. The remaining three courses tackle three core areas that all managers should understand: hiring employees, evaluating their performance, and rewarding them. Throughout the courses, an accessible, scientific approach is embraced such that best practices and practical tips are informed by research, but presented in accessible, applied ways. Upon completing the specialization, learners will have a deeper understanding of what works in the workplace, including a toolkit of best practices for hiring, managing, and rewarding employees. The specialization will be valuable for managers and entrepreneurs taking on these responsibilities as well as anyone else interested in the fundamental principles of human resource management. The Capstone Project will provide an opportunity to apply this knowledge to a real situation, including your own organization or work unit if desired.Applied Learning ProjectThe projects apply the knowledge learned to specific work groups of your choosing (e.g., your own work team). You will learn how to proactively identify key challenges around staffing, performance management, and compensation and then use this to construct strategies and plans for addressing these challenges in the context of your chosen work group.",

The first course describes how Information Systems address business problems. This takes the form of an IT alignment model that describes how Information Systems provide capabilities that enable or support organizational strategy. This component also includes an economic analysis of the Information System. The second course in the specialization entails the practice of modeling information systems. The goal of this course is to describe the Information System defined in the first course, so that the Information System can be developed. The third course provides an overview of the capabilities of modern enterprise systems. The goal of this course is to understand the capabilities of enterprise systems, so that the firm can decide if the requirement identified in the second course can be met by an enterprise system. Managerial aspects related to the selection and implementation of enterprise systems will also be discussed. The fourth course in the specialization describes the IT infrastructure choices available to a modern enterprise and the tradeoffs associated with each alternative. Any large Information System implementation is a significant organizational change initiative that requires careful stewardship. All the courses will deal with the issue of change management and discuss strategies and approaches for achieving a successful implementation.Applied Learning ProjectThe course projects will enable a student to take a business problem, conceptualize an IT solution, define the specifications of the IT system, and evaluate enterprise system options or develop a custom solution, to address the business problem. In this way, the projects will provide a practical manifestation of the key learning outcomes by enabling a student to apply the core lessons from the four courses to solve a business problem. ",

In these five courses, you will explore integrative therapies, including herbal medicine, guided imagery, aromatherapy, and mindfulness. For each therapy studied, you will gain skills to: Assess if a therapy is appropriate, Educate patients or clients about benefit and risk, Administer or advise on use, and Evaluate if the therapy was useful (our AEAE approach). By the end of this specialization, you will be familiar with application methods, mechanisms of action, and the research evidence for specific therapies, as well as safety and quality considerations. In short, you will be ready to partner with patients on developing a plan of integrative care that fits their needs and preferences. Note that while the primary focus is on working with patients or clients, the information is also immediately applicable to your own health and wellbeing.Applied Learning ProjectEach course in this specialization includes a peer-reviewed project that applies integrative therapies to a specific situation.  To begin, you will analyze what is needed to bring integrative therapies into your workplace or other setting.  In later courses, you will research the benefits and risks of specific herbal medicines and essential oils for specific patients or clients; create a guided imagery recording; and make recommendations based on evidence and patient preferences for herbal medicines, aromatherapy, guided imagery, and mindfulness practice.  Throughout, the focus will be on assessing patient needs and educating and advising patients in clear, simple, and patient-centered language.",

Developed at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and led by top-ranked otorhinolaryngology faculty and experts, this specialization on ear, nose and throat disorders focuses on the basics of the anatomy and pathophysiology of these regions.This specialization starts with an outline of what patients and professionals need to know about voice disorders. The course describes the last 40 years of knowledge gained in vocal production physiology and management options for voice disorders, the knowledge gap created between patients and practitioners, and the entirely new subspecialties of laryngology that have developed in response to this gap.Seeking to address these gaps, the specialization takes a deeper dive to deliver a comprehensive review of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. This course will describe the potential benefits offered by sinus surgery, as well as the indications to pursue this treatment modality. The course also reviews the necessary preparation and steps of the procedure, as well as important anatomic landmarks during surgical dissection.Lastly, it focuses on the pathophysiology of each type of hearing loss and common pathology in the outer, middle, and inner areas of the ear. From this, learners will also gain an understanding of available treatments for various ear conditions.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will be able to classify disorder and treatments of the outer, inner, and middle ear, identify the basic anatomy and physiology of the speaking and singing voice, and describe the role of surgery for sinusitis and activity evaluation. Illustrated images and CT scans will be used to review the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses. The microscopic appearance of the sinus mucosa will also be reviewed, utilizing dynamic multimedia to enhance your understanding. Learners will also assess the importance of mucociliary function in normal sinus anatomy. From this learners will be introduced to efficient voice production methods.

        "description": "The modern day business is a dynamic enterprise, and leading it now needs a conglomerate of essential skills, ranging from design thinking and digital transformation, to product management and IT.This specialization covers these essential skills and concepts, and what they mean for companies and businesses.  It starts with digital transformation, developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, and led by top-ranked Darden faculty and Boston Consulting Group global management experts.  It then introduces design thinking, which provides you with the tools to become an innovative thinker and uncover creative opportunities at every level in every kind of organization.  The specialization then switches gears into what it takes to become a product person in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital age, which is a different game relative to what product management used to be.  Finally, since now more than ever, companies are investing heavily in IT, the last part of this specialization will cover major challenges within corporate IT, and how to address them with the disciplined use of design thinking.  Applied Learning ProjectLearners will go from utilizing the BCG digital transformation framework, to create the actionable focus to successfully manage your product to rapidly prototyping strategically-aligned processes for implementation within your IT infrastructure.  Specifically, you will learn how to iteratively prototype and test solutions to make sure not just that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break, but that they deliver superior outcomes, as well as step through customer discovery, idea testing/validation, early development, and business model design.

The first key to success is building a team of exceptional, diverse leaders who are deeply involved in talent acquisition, development and retention activities. Learners will study how organizational leaders use different decision-making processes for different situations and that they are ultimately accountable for all results. Techniques for building enduring relationships that have a multiplicative impact on business success will be examined. This specialization provides insight into big picture considerations that organizational leaders must take into account when strategizing, planning and performing large scale technical endeavors.This specialization can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the ME-EM is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience. Learn more about the ME-EM program at https://www.coursera.org/degrees/me-engineering-management-boulder.Applied Learning ProjectEach week students will explore leadership topics through knowledge-check quizzes, readings, and responding to a real life leadership scenario with a one page paper. The leadership scenario responses are graded on an understanding of the topic, application of your strengths and personality type and a professionally written response. These one page responses will be graded by 3 peer reviewers against a rubric. Writing a very good one-page paper can be more difficult than writing a much longer piece. This is one of the most important and practical types of writing to master. Being a peer reviewer encourages you to be a critical thinker and enhances your communication skills. Peer reviews teach you how to communicate positive and constructive feedback, a critical leadership skill.",

The topical approach of each course allows learners to develop sets of vocabularies that will form the foundation for a broad understanding of the language. Learners will start with the basics, including common expressions, pronunciation and grammar, and work toward building a functional vocabulary of the 1500 most commonly used Spanish words. The specialization includes 4 courses that progressively build on the skills learned previously, and culminates in a project that allows learners to apply their knowledge and language skills. Applied Learning ProjectLearners will demonstrate the vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation skills learned in each course through a short written piece and an oral presentation to be graded by their peers.At the conclusion of the Specialization, learners will prepare a written travel plan that will take you to a pre- or post- Columbian Spanish speaking nation for an extended period of time for either business or pleasure travel.

Harvard Business Review calls it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most important general-purpose technology of our era.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut while there are so many how-to courses for hands-on techies, there are practically none that also serve the business leadership of machine learning \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a striking omission, since success with machine learning relies on a very particular project leadership practice just as much as it relies on adept number crunching.By filling that gap, this course empowers you to generate value with ML. It delivers the end-to-end expertise you need, covering both the core technology and the business-side practice.Why cover both sides? Because both sides need to learn both sides! This includes everyone leading or participating in the deployment of ML.NO HANDS-ON. Rather than a hands-on training, this specialization serves both business leaders and burgeoning data scientists with expansive, holistic coverage.BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master.WHAT YOU'LL LEARN. How ML works, how to report on its ROI and predictive performance, best practices to lead an ML project, technical tips and tricks, how to avoid the major pitfalls, whether true AI is coming or is just a myth, and the risks to social justice that stem from ML.Applied Learning ProjectProblem-solving challenges: Form an elevator pitch, build a predictive model by hand in Excel or Google Sheets to visualize how it improves, and more (no exercises involve the use of ML software).Vendor-NeutralThis specialization includes several illuminating software demos of ML in action using SAS products. However, the curriculum is vendor-neutral and universally-applicable. The learnings apply, regardless of which ML software you end up choosing to work with.In-Depth Yet AccessibleBrought to you by a veteran industry leader who won teaching awards when he was a professor at Columbia University, this specialization stands out as one of the most thorough, engaging, and surprisingly accessible on the subject of ML.Like a University CourseThese three courses are also a good fit for college students, or for those planning for or currently enrolled in an MBA program. The breadth and depth of this specialization is equivalent to one full-semester MBA or graduate-level course.",

        "description": "The main goal of this specialization is to provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary to develop a strong foundation on core paradigms and algorithms of machine learning (ML), with a particular focus on applications of ML to various practical problems in Finance. The specialization aims at helping students to be able to solve practical ML-amenable problems that they may encounter in real life that include: (1) mapping the problem on a general landscape of available ML methods, (2) choosing particular ML approach(es) that would be most appropriate for resolving the problem, and (3) successfully implementing a solution, and assessing its performance. The specialization is designed for three categories of students:\u00c2\u00b7       Practitioners working at financial institutions such as banks, asset management firms or hedge funds\u00c2\u00b7       Individuals interested in applications of ML for personal day trading\u00c2\u00b7       Current full-time students pursuing a degree in Finance, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering or other related disciplines who want to learn about practical applications of ML in Finance.The modules can also be taken individually to improve relevant skills in a particular area of applications of ML to finance.Applied Learning ProjectThe specialization is essentially in ML where all examples, home assignments and course projects deal with various problems in Finance (such as stock trading, asset management, and banking applications), and the choice of topics is respectively driven by a focus on ML methods that are used by practitioners in Finance. The specialization is meant to prepare the students to work on complex machine learning projects in finance that often require both a broad understanding of the whole field of ML, and understanding of appropriateness of different methods available in a particular sub-field of ML (for example, Unsupervised Learning) for addressing practical problems they might encounter in their work.

One critical component of value creation for customers in marketing that is often overlooked is how customers want to buy.  The ability to make its products and services available to customers at the right place and time is a key source of explosive value and the purview of marketing channel strategy.  \nWe will unpack \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe black box\u00e2\u0080\u009d of organizational channels, distribution and retailers that create the routes to market between the firm and its end user or customers.  In this course, you will learn how to capture and leverage this value through the careful selection of channel partners, the application of appropriate incentives and pricing agreements, the design and management of multiple channels.We also discuss how these ideas extend to and should be applied to social business channels in emerging economies and entrepreneurship (startup) environments as well as the latest challenges in selling on third party platforms/marketplaces.  In doing so, the goal is to provide you with the relevant frameworks, tools, and processes for more effective management of these areas, including the advantages, limitations, common uses and some best practice examples.  This is accomplished through case studies and exercises, lectures, and guest lecturers. Applied Learning ProjectLearners will gain an understanding of how to build, incentivize, and redesign efficient and effective routes-to-market for products and services via the use of intermediaries such as wholesalers, retailers, and a range of possible channel partners.  Through the use of lectures, case studies, and guest speakers, learners will be able to assess, evaluate, and recommend changes to build, improve, and revise new and existing channel strategies.  New sources of value, outside of the traditional product and service offering, are identified that better accommodate and ultimately optimize \"how the customer wants to buy.\"  Strategies for improving purchase convenience, service offerings, and information at the right place and time across omnichannel settings are identified and critiqued.

        "description": "For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.Applied Learning ProjectThrough the assignments of this specialisation you will use the skills you have learned to produce mini-projects with Python on interactive notebooks, an easy to learn tool which will help you apply the knowledge to real world problems. For example, using linear algebra in order to calculate the page rank of a small simulated internet, applying multivariate calculus in order to train your own neural network, performing a non-linear least squares regression to fit a model to a data set, and using principal component analysis to determine the features of the MNIST digits data set.",

The goal of this course is to offer emerging DE&I Practitioners tools, best practices, and strategies to best position and launch successful DE&I efforts regardless of where their organizations are on the DE&I continuum. Through the lens of an equal opportunity professional and the use of current events, learners can expect to explore the essential components of DE&I excellence and how to manage the shifting attitude towards social justice and the multiple dimensions of difference within their workforce.Applied Learning ProjectThe hands-on projects for this specialization will allow learners to practice DE&I tools and best practices taught by offering them an opportunity to develop and implement DE&I strategies within their organizational programming. These projects are designed to provide emerging DE&I Practitioners with a chance to launch and/or grow their DE&I deliverables that connect to the unique cultural realities that exist in their workplaces. At the conclusion of the specialization, learners will have developed a portfolio of DE&I-related work products and assessments which is expected to include feedback from their DE&I peers, co-workers, and supervisors.

Hundreds of plant genomes have been sequenced, RNA-seq has enabled transcriptome-wide expression profiling, and a proliferation of \"-seq\"-based methods has permitted protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to be determined cheaply and in a high-throughput manner. These data sets in turn allow us to generate hypotheses at the click of a mouse or tap of a finger.The Plant Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera introduces core bioinformatic competencies and resources, such as NCBI's Genbank, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics in Bioinformatic Methods I, followed by protein-protein interaction, structural bioinformatics and RNA-seq analysis in Bioinformatic Methods II. In Plant Bioinformatics we cover 33 plant-specific online tools from genome browsers to transcriptomic data mining to promoter/network analyses and others. Last, a Plant Bioinformatics Capstone uses these tools to hypothesize a biological role for a gene of unknown function, summarized in a written lab report.This specialization is useful to any modern plant molecular biologist wanting to get a feeling for the incredible scope of data available to researchers. A small amount of R programming is introduced in Bioinformatic Methods II, but most of the tools are web applications. It is recommended that you have access to a laptop or desktop computer for running these as they may not work as mobile applications on your phone or tablet.Applied Learning ProjectThe Plant Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera introduces core bioinformatic competencies and resources, such as NCBI's Genbank, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics in Bioinformatic Methods I, followed by protein-protein interaction, structural bioinformatics and RNA-seq analysis in Bioinformatic Methods II.

We've put together these three courses with the explicit intent of helping people prepare for the rigors of a prestigious MBA program, as well as introducing and refreshing basic knowledge and skills for aspiring business leaders. Having taught at Rice for nearly a combined 40 years, professors James Weston and Brian Rountree have found that entering students often lack confidence in some fundamental quantitative skills, as well as struggling with accounting and finance mechanics and terminology. As a result we have put together a series of lectures, plenty of practice opportunities and video walk-throughs that will allow you to confidently take a seat at the leadership table.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will have the opportunity to practice foundational math skills, familiarize themselves with terminology, and complete scenario-based problems commonly found in finance or accounting courses. More specifically, learners will construct financial statements, navigate key concepts and tools in financial accounting, identify basic principles of financial valuation discounting, perform some data analysis, and more.",

We hope this course will enthuse you to look further into privacy, personal data regulation and standardisation. Especially in the light of recent events it becomes more important to know about  your (alleged!?) rights and freedoms. The courses on privacy provide you with a historical perspective on the developments of privacy rights in an international context. The course on standardisation shows you the legal context and the scalable power of standardisation. Both topics are presented in a technological context. The course on Privacy in the Western World provides you with the differences between the USA and Europe, and the details of Europe and USA will be explained extensively in the follow-up courses.The specialization will help you build a comprehensive opinion and it will challenge you in all areas of present-day privacy protection. It will link historic milestones to current limitations and offer you a journey through jurisdictions and technological fields alike.Through video lectures and quizzes we endeavor to build a solid foundation for you to construct a well-founded opinion on privacy and standardisation. Last but not least we sincerely hope you enjoy the course! Prof.mr.dr.

We will begin at the beginning, with variables, conditionals, and loops, and get to some intermediate material like keyword parameters, list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and class inheritance.You will have lots of opportunities to practice. You will also learn ways to reason about program execution, so that it is no longer mysterious and you are able to debug programs when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work.By the end of the specialization, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be writing programs that query Internet APIs for data and extract useful information from them.  And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to learn to use new modules and APIs on your own by reading the documentation. That will give you a great launch toward being an independent Python programmer.This specialization is a good next step for you if you have completed Python for EverybodyOpens in a new tab but want a more in-depth treatment of Python fundamentals and more practice, so that you can proceed with confidence to specializations like Applied Data Science with PythonOpens in a new tab.But it is also appropriate as a first set of courses in Python if you are already familiar with some other programming language, or if you are up for the challenge of diving in head-first.Applied Learning ProjectBy the end of the second course, you will create a simple sentiment analyzer that counts the number of positive and negative words in tweets. In the third course, you will mash up two APIs to create a movie recommender. The final course, Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv (Course 5), is an extended project in which you'll perform optical character recognition (OCR) and object detection in images.",

It has four main objectives:To inspire you to codeTo help you think in codeTo teach you technical concepts to codeTo give you useful examples of things to do in codeThere is a steep learning curve on learning to code, and that is why this Specialization emphasizes motivation. You have to want to learn to code and stick with it through multiple learning activities and your own experimentation, research, and practice. This single Specialization will not teach you to code. It will, however, get you started with a mindset for coding, understanding of Python technical concepts, and an appreciation of what can be done with Python to access and interact with data on the Internet. These skills are increasingly essential for researchers.The wealth of data that is now available to researchers who can use Python and other tools to access it is transforming academic disciplines, including the social sciences. But there's a gap between the questions about human nature that we know internet data can cast light on, and the raw, messy reality of code and data. Each course in this Specialization has code demonstrations that you run that show how to use Python to bridge the gap and to discover things about ourselves, our friends, each other, and society, as we interact with the Internet in code. We look forward to being a part of your continuing education!

        "description": "The Real-Time Embedded Systems specialization is a series of four course taking you from a beginning practitioner, to a more advanced real-time system analyst and designer.  Knowledge and experience gained on hard to master topics such as predictable response services, when to allocate requirements to hardware or software, as well as mission critical design will enhance your engineering talent.  You will gain experience building a simple, but real, system project with real-time challenges, that will boost your confidence.   The hands-on, at home, project hardware is affordable, widely available, and quick-time-to market  methods leverage Linux  real-time extensions, open source RTOS (Real-Time  Operating System), as well as tried and true cyclic executives.  After you complete all four courses in the series, you can consider yourself an intermediate to more advanced real-time system practitioner.  This knowledge is invaluable for medical, aerospace, transportation, energy, digital entertainment, telecommunications, and other exciting embedded career options.The series stresses hands-on practice and assessment of your learning progress, not only based on knowledge acquisition, but by teaching you to put theory into practice and how to evaluate design options and make optimal choices.  The unique final project allows you to see real-time challenges with your eyes, to debug interactively, and build a simple at-home detection, tracking and synchronization system.Applied Learning ProjectProject work includes a series of real-time processing and concurrency exercises along with analysis and design in the first two courses.  The third course provides experience with mission critical components like error correction code memory, flash file systems, and redundant hardware.  In the final course, you put all of the practice together into your own design to build a real-time system that you can test at home.  The project covers topics including: concurrency, Linux kernel modules, machine vision, co-processors, and correct function with timing constraints.  You will use specific real-time extensions to Linux and compare advantages and disadvantages of Linux to more traditional RTOS, cyclic executive, and FPGA options.  The experience you gain can be used to launch additional exploration of hybrid FPGA systems (e.g. Altera and Xilinx), GP-GPU (e.g. NVIDIA), and multi-core scale-up (e.g. ARM A and R-Series) as well as MCU scale-down solutions (ARM M-Series microprocessors).",

        "description": "Discover how to write elegant code that works the first time it is run.This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will build small to medium size Scala applications by applying knowledge and skills including: functional programming, parallel programming, manipulation of large data sets, higher-order functions, property-based testing, functional reactive programming.",

Social Entrepreneurship describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change. We will introduce you to examples of Social Entrepreneurship and guide you through the process of establishing a venture to address a social or environment problem. You will form of team and study a problematic issue to learn more about the source of the problem. We will equip you with frameworks identifying opportunities, support your team, and outlining your idea. You will develop your idea and iterate on your business model throughout the Specialization, and conclude with completing a business plan.Applied Learning ProjectEntrepreneurship is not about a single genius doing magic, but about a group of people who combine forces, take action and initiate change. Throughout the 3 courses learners will be encouraged to work in teams and form a social venture. They are asked to reach out to people who share similar thoughts and concerns about a particular topic to eventually form a team. This team will focus on a very specific issue and do research to examine the source of the problem. Results will be used to identify an opportunity to address this problem. Gradually a business model will be developed. Learners will choose an organizational form, devise an appropriate financial structure and start to create a business plan. Measuring social impact and selecting the right strategy to scale will define success. Whether a team sticks to the very same members and project throughout all 3 courses will depend on the individual learners. Changing topics or switching teams is possible anytime. ",

Knowing how policies are constructed, what values underlie them, and how they succeed or fail makes everyone more effective at work or in their civic role. This specialization includes an HONORS track in which learners will complete a professional social policy analysis.Teachers, health care workers, police, and social workers interact with policy daily, but all of us should care about the impact and effectiveness of these programs. Health and mental health programs, education, housing and income supports, pensions, criminal justice services, veterans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 programs, child protective services, and immigration services create a support system all Americans will draw upon. They also reveal Americans' ethics and values, indicating how we regard and care for our most vulnerable. This specialization will explore the size, structure, and outcomes of U.S. social policy by-comparing it with the approaches of other developed nations.-examining the history of our efforts and probing population effects that shape policy.-looking deeply into support for families in general, poor families, people with disabilities, and the elderly.-mapping out existing policies for housing, education, healthcare, immigration and child welfare. -addressing issues of power, oppression, and white supremacy.By the end of the course the learner will be at home working in, utilizing, and voting in the U.S. welfare system.Applied Learning ProjectALL learners will engage with the video lectures and use quizzes to confirm their understanding of U.S. social policy and their skills at navigating policy programs.  HONORS learners will read course-related articles and write a summary and critique in response to each reading.

Involving lectures from over 50 experts from all faculties at Macquarie University, we look at solving complex problems in a way that has never been done before.Please note that this specialisation will be discontinued on Monday 30 September 2024.  To meet this deadline, please enrol by 5pm AEST Saturday 30 September 2023 and complete the course by 5pm AEST 30 September 2024.This specialisation uses the framework of Big History which synthesizes knowledge across the sciences and the humanities, and provides a powerful foundation to think and research in new ways. Big History has been embraced as an important global framework by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Presentations at WEF by Professor David Christian, one of the creators of this specialization, have included \u00e2\u0080\u0098Interdisciplinary Approaches to Solving 21st Century Challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Davos 2012), \u00e2\u0080\u0098Big History for Big Picture Thinking\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Davos 2014), and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Big History, Big Decisions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Tianjin 2014). In 2015, the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos had four sessions devoted to Big History including three interdisciplinary \u00e2\u0080\u0098Big History, Big Future\u00e2\u0080\u0099 panels on cooperation, innovation, and global growth and stability. These interdisciplinary discussion panels were the inspiration for this Solving Complex Problems Specialization. Applied Learning ProjectTo solve complex problems, whether it is the challenge of developing a new product, or Einstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s task of trying to explain how gravity worked - and literally everything else in between - it is not enough to take the problem and apply already existing skills. The skill that has always led to big breakthroughs in any field or industry is the skill of seeing something in a new way. That is the vital skill you will learn in this Coursera specialization.From the very start of the specialization, your assignments will be geared toward tackling a complex issue of your choice which you face in your career path, industry, or field. Each phase of the course builds up to a briefing paper that analyzes, evaluates, and attempts to solve a highly complex problem. The specialization advances your knowledge of your own field by teaching you to look at it in new ways and it fosters your own revolutionary new innovations.",

The specialization invites learners to develop competency in these three areas through targeted content delivery, continuous concept reinforcement, and project applications.The goal of the specialization is to introduce the theories related to spacecraft dynamics and control.  This includes the three-dimensional description of orientation, creating the dynamical rotation models, as well as the feedback control development to achieve desired attitude trajectories.  Applied Learning ProjectThe capstone project integrates the analytical skills you build through the courses into a Mars mission concept where the attitude pointing of a small satellite is developed for different mission requirements. Numerical simulations are developed to validate the predicted closed loop attitude control.",

Analysis of team and player performance data has continued to revolutionize the sports industry on the field, court, and ice as well as in living rooms among fantasy sports players and online sports gambling. Drawing from real data sets in Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the English Premier League (EPL-soccer), and the Indian Premier League (IPL-cricket), you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn how to construct predictive models to anticipate team and player performance. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also replicate the success of Moneyball using real statistical models, use the Linear Probability Model (LPM) to anticipate categorical outcomes variables in sports contests, explore how teams collect and organize an athlete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance data with wearable technologies, and how to apply machine learning in a sports analytics context. This  introduction to the field of sports analytics is designed for sports managers, coaches, physical therapists, as well as sports fans who want to understand the science behind athlete performance and game prediction. New Python programmers and data analysts who are looking for a fun and practical way to apply their Python, statistics, or predictive modeling skills will enjoy exploring courses in this series.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will apply methods and techniques learned to sports datasets to generate their own results rather than relying on the data processing performed by others. As a consequence the learner will be empowered to explore their own ideas about sports team performance, test them out using the data, and so become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.",

It is designed for those entering advanced fields such as combustion, high temperature gas dynamics, environmental sciences, or materials processing, or wishes to build a background for understanding advanced experimental diagnostic techniques in these or similar fields. It covers the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic thermodynamics and derives properties for gases, liquids and solids. It also covers non-equilibrium behavior as found in kinetic theory and chemical kinetics. The main innovation is the use of the postulatory approach to introducing fundamental concepts and the very clear connection between macroscopic and microscopic thermodynamics. By introducing basic ideas using postulates, students are given a very straightforward way to think about important concepts, including entropy and temperature, ensembles and quantum mechanics. Applied Learning ProjectAssessment for the five courses in this specialization will be carried out using short, auto-graded problem sets that will test mastery of content presented in videos. Students will also be asked to submit problems without a clear method of solution for peer-review and to solve other problems on discussion boards.

We all live in multiple digital worlds that are changing rapidly with new apps, devices, and data analyses offering a constant stream of innovations and technology integrations for our lives.As it's an integral part of our lives, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working towards computer science for all - making it possible for every student, every future member of society, to understand computing and technology. To do so, we need teachers. Teachers prepared to both teach computational concepts and use best practices so kids enjoy and see they can be successful in computer science. This is where you (and this Specialization) come in!In this Specialization you will both learn about the impacts of computing in our world and how to teach these impacts to K-12 students. We offer both the technical knowledge and also the pedagogical approaches for teaching these concepts. Along the way you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll engage with freely available materials you can use in your own classroom, as well as learn from teachers currently teaching these concepts in their classrooms.In short - in this Specialization we'll teach you the computing concepts you need to know and then help you explore and evaluate lesson plans and resources to prepare you for your classroom.Applied Learning ProjectUsing a problem-based approach to understanding underlying computing concepts, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll travel through five different digital \u00e2\u0080\u009cworlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which we engage with technology, exploring the problems posed within that world and the various tech solutions that exist.At the end of each world, you will reflect on the effectiveness of your learning process and evaluate lesson plans and materials available for use in your own classroom. Through these activities, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll become a more reflective teacher and develop an understanding of how instruction and activities can be designed to support learning. See FAQ for per-course details.As a culminating project, you will complete part of the new advanced placement computer science course - the \u00e2\u0080\u009cExplore Task\u00e2\u0080\u009d - where you research a recent computing innovation and and analyze its impacts on the world.

These programs vary widely but most share a concern for five individual, student competencies: self awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and finally responsible decision making. It is important for teachers and parents to know about and understand these programs. While lots of SEL programs emphasize K-12 student social and emotional learning, only a very few programs exist to promote, and help teachers explore their own emotional well-being. In this Specialization our central premise is this:To facilitate students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 social and emotional learning, a teacher must know the student as a person. This means that the teacher must strive to know her or him self. In order to help students achieve a degree of well-being, teachers need to be aware of their own well-being.In our Specialization, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Teacher and SEL\u00e2\u0080\u009d the instructors (Randy Testa and Dan Liston, as well as Emily Price and Ben Kirshner) examine kindergarten through high school SEL programs, looking at both established programs and less well-known community-based and youth empowerment approaches. Along with this examination of K-12 SEL programs, we bring a much needed emphasis on the teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well being.Applied Learning ProjectStudents will utilize course knowledge and skills to create either a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Teacher Implementation Plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 focused on developing student or teacher SELprograms, or a cinema project examining student & teacher SEL implications in educationally oriented films.

You'll be translating user specs into unit tests, applying the Red-Green-Refactor mantra, and applying mocks in python with the unit test mock module.You'll learn to integrate best practices of test-driven development into your programming workflow and refactor legacy codebases with the help of agile methodologies. We will explore continuous integration and how to write automated tests in Python. Finally, we will work everything we've learned together to write code that contains error handlers, automated tests, and refactored functions.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will apply skills related to test-driven development in a capstone project, testing your ability to use exception handling, mock objects, and unit tests in a TDD lifecycle. After completion, you'll have a portfolio piece program that demonstrates you have a solid understanding of all concepts related to TDD!",

The goal is for learners to incorporate evaluations of data quality into their process as a critical component for all projects. We sincerely hope to disseminate knowledge about total data quality to all learners, such as data scientists and quantitative analysts, who have not had sufficient training in the initial steps of the data science process that focus on data collection and evaluation of data quality. We feel that extensive knowledge of data science techniques and statistical analysis procedures will not help a quantitative research study if the data collected/gathered are not of sufficiently high quality.This specialization will focus on the essential first steps in any type of scientific investigation using data: either generating or gathering data, understanding where the data come from, evaluating the quality of the data, and taking steps to maximize the quality of the data prior to performing any kind of statistical analysis or applying data science techniques to answer research questions. Given this focus, there will be little material on the analysis of data, which is covered in myriad existing Coursera specializations. The primary focus of this specialization will be on understanding and maximizing data quality prior to analysis. Applied Learning ProjectLearners will gain valuable and applicable knowledge and skills about the Total Data Quality framework from interviews with leading experts in this area, engaging lectures, live demonstrations of concepts using software and case studies, and will complete practical assessments to solidify concepts and reinforce essential ideas.",

The specialization consists of 4 courses that are composed of a basic part with lectures and quizzes, and a practical  \"honors\" part, which includes physically assembling and implementing functionality atop a networked device (please note: while the honors part of the courses is optional, it is required to purchase hardware to complete these practical parts of the courses). The courses are meant to be taken in sequence, as each course builds on the previous one, while adding more functions to the device in the honors section. The construction of the device introduces real-world challenges and technological approaches commonly encountered in the IoT industry and builds students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 confidence that they can do things for real.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will be introduced to the concepts and technologies in Internet of Things. In the (optional) Honors section, we will build an actual small self-driving vehicle, using networking and sensor technologies. Throughout the honors parts of the four courses, the vehicle will become more refined, gaining capabilities such as environmental sensing, computer vision, autonomous driving, cloud-based analytics, and more. Again, we need to mention that a prerequisite to complete this part of the courses is a basic kit of hardware that you need to purchase. If you don't want to complete the honors parts, you don't need the hardware.",
