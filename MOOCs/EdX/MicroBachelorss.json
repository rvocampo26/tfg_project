You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore how large-scale shifts in the climate structure trigger water and food shortages, as well as how technology advances to address these global issues.\nPhysical chemistry is fundamental to an understanding of worldwide energy sources and constraints. By the end of this MicroBachelors program, learners will have the quantitative reasoning and critical thinking skills to link the foundations of chemistry to the current global strategies for energy forecasts, technology connecting energy and climate, and role of modern materials science.",
