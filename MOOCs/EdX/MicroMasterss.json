To prepare you, we have invested thousands of hours designing challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. We believe in learning through application, especially when it comes to learning algorithms.\nFor each algorithm you develop and implement, we have designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. ",

This previously unimaginable scale has become possible by thoroughly understanding the critical mechanisms that take place at the scale of individual atoms and molecules. Similarly, nanophotonic devices are built into the core of modern life through technologies such as fiber-optic communications, also known as the backbone of the internet. \nYou can now learn how to design advanced nanoelectronics and nanophotonics from the creators of nanoHUB, the global nanotechnology research and education portal, even with no prior background in nanotechnology or quantum mechanics. A uniquely designed sequence of courses will help you develop a unified understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale electronic and photonic devices (e.g., field effect transistors, interconnects, lasers and modulators) as well as their important applications in integrated circuits and future electronic and photonic systems.\nThis sequence of short courses builds all critical concepts from the ground up. Starting from the familiar concepts behind Ohm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, the lessons in these short courses lead naturally to a new perspective on even some of the basic physics concepts. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions about what happens at smaller length scales than we can readily observe but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons or other exotic states. Concepts and applications in nanophotonics and fiber optics communications are also discussed. Furthermore, you will learn about the key enabling characteristics of the latest advances in nanophotonic, plasmonic, and metamaterial components and systems.\nThese courses are intended to be broadly accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering.

Often, performance and cost requirements drive product designs to possess relatively small margins of safety. Since materials degrade with time, the resulting product life is finite. Engineers are challenged to design the product to ensure predictable reliability while optimally achieving the goals of performance and cost.\nMaking optimal decisions considering tradeoffs between diverse objectives is an essential activity in all organizations and teams involved in engineering design and product development. The ability to effectively make design decisions, and to coordinate the decisions of a team are valuable competencies for various roles in the industry, including those of systems engineers, design engineers, and engineering managers.\nBoth product reliability as well as  design decisions  require an assessment of uncertainty in product lifetimes or market factors.  Product lifetimes are inherently uncertain, due to uncertainty in geometrical dimensions, material parameters or loading conditions. Assessment of market risk and uncertainty is crucial for good design decisions. Therefore, the tools and techniques of probability and statistics that are critical to the study of uncertainty form an important learning of this program. Analyzing the uncertainty and designing to reduce failure probability and the uncertainty in product performance represents another important goal. The physics of material degradation and the common failure mechanisms in mechanical and electronic products is an important learning, as well.\nThis MicroMasters program will benefit a wide range of practitioners and active learners, whether entry level engineers or transitioning into engineering management roles. The learning outcomes of this program will have applicability to products across all major engineering disciplines including automotive, aerospace, biomedical and electronics industries.  This MicroMasters program from the best ranked online Mechanical Engineering Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree program will prepare the student for leadership roles in product development or engineering management.\nThe program content is suitable for individuals with an undergraduate degree in engineering, or a related field.

Its fundamental purpose is to help you meet current societal needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \nYou will learn that sustainable agriculture is more than a collection of sustainable agriculture methods and practices. It is also a process of negotiation: a push and pull between the sometimes competing interests of an individual farmer, a community, a nation, or geo-political groups as they work to solve complex problems about how to grow crops and livestock.\nAs a practitioner of sustainable agriculture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 manager, grower, food processor, distributor, retailer, consumer, waste manager, or policymaker \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Sustainable Agriculture MicroMasters program will equip you to play a role in ensuring a sustainable agricultural system. A systems perspective is essential to understanding sustainability and implies interdisciplinary efforts. \nYou will gain an understanding of the importance of the sustainable agriculture system in its broadest sense, from the individual farm, to the local ecosystem, and to communities affected by crop and livestock production practices, both locally and globally. An emphasis on the system allows a larger and more thorough view of the consequences of crop and livestock practices on both human communities and the environment. A systems approach gives you the tools to explore the interconnections between agriculture and other aspects of our environment.\nFarmers, laborers, policymakers, researchers, retailers, consumers, and managers have a responsibility to reach toward the goal of sustainable agriculture. This MicroMasters program provides you with the fundamental knowledge so that you can uniquely contribute to strengthen the sustainable agriculture community. ",
