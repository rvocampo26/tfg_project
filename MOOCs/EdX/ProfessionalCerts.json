First, you will be able to apply an invertibility criterion for a square matrix that plays a pivotal role in, for example, computer graphics and in other more advanced courses, such as multivariable calculus. The first course then moves on to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The goal of this part of the course is to decompose the action of a linear transformation that may be visualized. The main applications described here are to discrete dynamical systems, including Markov chains. However, the basic concepts afforded by eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful throughout industry, science, engineering and mathematics.\nIn the second course you will explore methods to compute an approximate solution to an inconsistent system of equations that have no solutions. This has a central role in the understanding of current data science applications. The second course then turns to symmetric matrices. They arise often in applications of the singular value decomposition, which is another tool often found in data science and machine learning.",

At the same time, buildings and their energy systems are responsible for around 40% of the worldwide energy consumption and carbon emissions.\nIn this program you will learn how to design energy efficient and more sustainable buildings whilst improving the thermal quality of their indoor environment.\nThis Program consists of four courses.\nIn order to consider how to increase the energy efficiency of new and existing buildings, you will discover the energy needs and thermal behavior of buildings. You will learn to answer questions like: how does solar radiation impact the heating and cooling needs? Is there something like an optimal window size, or optimum insulation or orientation? What is the impact of ventilation on the energy needs? Why do architects sometimes design fully glazed atria oriented to the north?\nA building not only has energy needs, but also energy supply. Therefore the second course takes you on a journey through the world of energy conversion and related carbon emissions. You will discover how to convert natural resources into the needed heat, cold and electricity. This course will give you the skills to choose energy systems for low  carbon buildings and building stocks.\nDuring the third course you will learn how to master a good indoor thermal comfort and how that closely relates to buildings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 energy systems. You will be able to answer questions like under which conditions is floor heating comfortable, or why does a comfortable temperature also depend on the chosen ventilation system. Or why there will always be comfort complains even in the building design.\nFinally, you will discover how to combine energy supply and (ground) storage systems and how to distribute heat, cold and air in buildings. You will know why and when to apply an all-air system, radiators, floor heating or a cooled ceiling.  You will understand the processes in air handling units and know how to maximize comfort while making sure the carbon emissions are the lowest possible. You will also discover the basics of how to optimally control all these systems.",

According to the International Data Corporation, by 2025 there will be 175 zetabytes of digital assets on the web. These include data, multimedia files, computing resources, software and more. There also social networks, many of which are purposely cultivated, which serve as a great source of collaboration and harnessing of collective wisdom. Meanwhile, Industry 4.0, or the Industrial Internet, provides an abundance of new opportunities for deploying intelligent applications in areas such as automation, monitoring, correction, decision, prediction and customization. Properly sourced data and harnessed knowledge are crucial for enabling business excellence. Competitive advantage is no longer achieved through an organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal operational excellence and competition with rival firms, but through competency building, harnessing collective wisdom, and collaboration through networks. New value chains that lead to superior customer experience are often realized by applying newfound technological knowledge to fields such as processes management, machine learning, Big Data, automated decision-making and business model innovation.\nBalancing theories and practice, and supplemented by in-depth case studies and practical illustrations, this program equips you with the skills and knowledge to strategize investments in digital transformations in an Industry 4.0 world. It covers everything from mining data, harnessing/sharing knowledge in organizations, leveraging the cloud for collaboration, competency building, innovation and fostering learning communities to identifying the skills today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge workers need.

The real-world examples provide a modern interpretation of how initiatives, including sustainability and technology adaptation, drive current Global Value Chains and their envisioned process and continuous improvement.\nIt is recommended the three-course program be taken in sequence. It guides learners through concepts and foundations of Quality, along with the use of both the basics, as well as the advanced, improvement tools and techniques to show the integration of lean to six sigma.\nThe program begins with CLSSYB01: Introduction to Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chains, guiding learners through the basic Six Sigma Methodology and foundations of Six Sigma and Supply Chain Management. CLSSYB01 provides an understanding of various topics starting with an introduction and overview of Six Sigma. The course will advance into DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) and its related six sigma tools. Learners will gain an understanding of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLean\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Six Sigma before moving into the roles and responsibilities of management and stakeholders within Lean Six Sigma in Supply Chain.\nAfter completing CLSSYB01, learners are encouraged to continue with CLSSYB02 and CLSSYB03 in order to obtain the Lean Six Sigma Certificate and gain further understanding on how to implement Lean Six Sigma Projects for optimization of supply chain and strong sustainability performance.\nThe Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable Supply Chain Program includes a second content course: CLSSYB02: Lean Six Sigma Program and Project Management, which expands upon the content of CLSSYB01.\nWithin CLSSYB02, the learner is taken through the applied use of the tools and metrics in the LSS program framework. This applied approach includes the basics of project management and lays out real-world methods to apply these tools at the basic level. This program prepares the learner with the necessary knowledge to be a team member (Yellow Belt) of LSS projects seeking synergies, product quality improvement, reduced variability, and shorter lead times.\nThe final course is a certification exam. CLSSYB03: ISCEA CLSSYB Exam, allows learners to display their knowledge acquired in the previous courses of the ISCEA Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable Supply Chain Program. If the program is successfully completed, the learner will obtain a credential recognized by the industry that supports improved workforce options for the learner: The Certified Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt Designation.\nWhile there are no enforced prerequisites to participate in the program, the Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable Supply Chain Program, on edX by ISCEA, is recommended for pre-career or early career Supply Chain professionals. Previous experience in, or future plans to enter into the areas of merchandising, inventory management, operations management, manufacturing industries, the production process, decision making, or buyer/planner role, complements the expertise gained via completion of the courses. ISCEA envisions learners who are seeking tangible skills, tutorials, and credentials to facilitate their progress into senior roles with more strategic oversight, to be successful candidates for the program. Learners who complete the program can immediately apply the lessons they learn to corporate roles and related value streams. Those focused on corporate process improvement, reduced environmental impact efforts, and customer satisfaction will receive great benefits from this program.

Circular reprocessing not only helps reduce both carbon dioxide emissions and healthcare costs but can also alleviate this pressure.\nThe courses in this program are intended to help designers, engineers, industry representatives, hospital staff and decision makers to facilitate a transition towards a circular economy in the healthcare sector. This would bring about environmental benefits by reducing the carbon footprint and waste streams produced by hospitals and related organizations.\nThese two courses use an interdisciplinary approach to create sustainable solutions: one from the suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perspective and the other one from the users/buyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perspective. The first course demonstrates how designers and suppliers can contribute to value creation in their business via the circular economy and the second helps hospitals and other healthcare organizations create smart circular economy solutions and reduce waste streams.\nYou will learn how to deal with the scarcity of raw materials, apply circular strategies (including reusing, repairing, remanufacturing and recycling), how to set-up a green team and to make recommendations for reducing waste streams. Furthermore, you will learn to identify entrepreneurial opportunities and smart solutions to design and create proposals for circular products and processes.\nThis program is developed by Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), ranked among the top universities in the QS World Rankings, in close collaboration with world-class experts from both the industry and academia. Therefore, it provides not only academic insights but also practical tools and examples which can be implemented in any organization, and can help you propose and develop your own circular solutions and programs.\nIf you enroll before October 9 you will benefit from a 40% discount (USD 268 instead of USD 448)",

        "description": "According to Gartner's research, by 2025, over 70% of organizations will use citizen-developed applications. The rise in using citizen development is because of an extreme shortage of software developers plus the rising cost of traditional software development. In addition, as organizations transform digitally, there is an increasing need for business applications. Therefore, citizen developers are needed to meet the growing demand for digital business applications.\nCitizen Developers need to master a new set of skills to succeed.\nMany citizen developers are skilled in business analysis, marketing, or business strategy. They have excellent critical thinking skills and analytical skills. However, citizen developers can be more effective if they acquire design thinking, product development and management, collaboration, customer education, and stakeholder management skills.\nThis program describes how to build a training program that will give the citizen developers the knowledge and skills to create valuable no-code/low-code digital applications. First, we teach citizen developers how to use design thinking to build effective business solutions. Then, citizen developers will learn how to create empathy for the customers' problems, visualize possible solutions through design workshops, and use rapid prototyping to test and deploy no-code/low-code solutions.\nOnce the no-code/low-code business application has been validated through prototyping, citizen developers will learn the basics of product development and management. Product development and management skills will aid citizen developers in supporting and enhancing the no-code/low-code products while educating customers on how to gain the most value from the products.\nOne of the most significant partnerships for citizen developers is the IT Department. Citizen developers and the IT staff must have a good working relationship to build good no-code/low-code applications that are secure and integrate well with the organization's IT architecture. In addition, citizen developers should know when to develop applications independently and when to call in help from the IT Department.\nFinally, this program will help teach citizen developers an agile project management method that is easily customizable to the unique needs of citizen development. Using Disciplined Agile, citizen developers will create Ways of Working (WoW) that provide just enough project management so they can deliver no-code/low-code solutions fast while maintaining high quality.\nThis certificate program is unique because it is the first training program to address citizen developers' learning and development needs. According to Mendix's 2021 survey of 2,025 IT professionals in six countries, in organizations that use no-code/low-code platforms, 56% of employees use citizen-developed apps. Thirty-three percent of organizations surveyed use citizen-developed apps for mission-critical operations. In addition, No-code/low-code projects reduce software application costs by 53% while delivering the applications 56% faster than traditional software projects.\nGet ahead of the citizen development revolution and prepare your organization for success by strengthening the essential skills for your citizen developers!",

The Smith and Clark schools leverages the foundational courses in Digital Strategy and Execution and extend those with a simulated course experience for the Government sector.\nGovernment sector leaders that are usually program managers, directors, or unit leads need to know how to sense and respond to digital technology. At its core, the basic lessons are the same. In practice, the complexity of bureaucracy and the need to consider internal marketing (politics) within each organization is also essential.\nThis course series will take its learners on a digital transformation journey where they build required skills to prove mastery. The last course in this series adds required lessons and simulates digital transformation in government based on real events and a real digital transformation. This allows government leaders to apply the skills and knowledge gained in the certificate by using micro-progressed case studies as scenarios to explore and solidify knowledge against the course objectives.\nCourse objectives include:\r\n\nIdentify critical technologies that have the potential for disruption across markets into your market, and how to respond to them.\nBetter sense and manage customer relationships within your organization, business partnerships, and end users to better identify opportunities and risks.\nKnow the customer journey analytics and Lean Analytics cycle that drive adoption of technologies and engage stakeholders with your program, product, or service offering.\nDefine your current and future capability sets, and what dynamic capabilities are needed to improve your ability to respond to stakeholder and customer needs.\nEstablish team and organization designs that align interests and create incentives that empower people to solve problems and engage in transformation.\nDrive outcomes with disciplined planning and execution that change the direction and capabilities of Agile Product Teams at scale.\nGovern and manage the technology mix that is required to enable empowered teams with DevOps principles and practices that drive fast flow, feedback, and team learning.\nKnow and be able to leverage relevant industry examples that serve as success stories to drive belief and vision with the art of the possible into your organization.\n",

Based on international benchmarking activities (Merrow, 2010), we know that an average of 40% of projects do not deliver what they promised.\nSo how can you as an engineer with a technical background improve your project performance?\nIn this program, you will learn the project management skills you need to successfully manage engineering projects. First you will focus on the early project phases, which are crucial to achieve project success. The areas covered include the project manager and the team, the project process and the project context. At the end of this part of the program you will have created your own project execution plan.\nBut how will you deal with the inherent uncertainties linked to the length and scale of engineering and infrastructure projects and their constantly changing environments? As with most external factors, many of the causes and consequences of these uncertainties are difficult to avoid or control. Attempts to overcome these challenges by simply trying to reduce their causes is not enough.\nIn the second part of the program you will learn our approach to mastering project complexity, focused on front-end development and teamwork. You will develop the skills you need to make timely actions in order to tackle complexities and improve your chances of project success.\nYou will learn to identify what makes a project complex and how to perform a complexity assessment. You will analyze these elements in the context of your own project. Then, based on our complexity framework, you will identify the complexity footprint of your project and use it to adapt your management processes. \nThis course has been designed by TU Delft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international experts on Project Complexity, and is based on more than 60 years of practical experience as well as relevant research in the field. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see projects still fail and there is a need to do things differently.

This Professional Certificate program will guide anyone with an interest in environmental management to a) obtain literacy in environmental issues, b) use data of different spatial scales to drive decision-making, and c) effectively communicate environmental policy across a broad spectrum of constituencies.\nWe will explore the evolution of environmental management among pioneering thought-leaders in conservation ecology and will utilize invaluable supplementary reading to understand how their essential texts remain relevant to this day.  Further, we will explore how early conservation and environmental movements were shaped by the reality of politics, policy, and science. Finally, we will explore how today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental managers inform effective policy when using a participatory, transdisciplinary approach to socio-environmental management and justice.\nEnvironmental decision-making requires an approach that best matches your skill sets and organizational needs with crucial environmental issues. We will explore case-studies of the management of large, complex systems, investigate how to scale and transfer the lessons-learned from these case studies, and explore strategies for integrating coupled human and natural systems. From these global examples, including Chesapeake Bay, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best studied estuary, you will learn how to develop solutions to your organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique socio-environmental challenges.\nBest-practice environmental management goes hand-in-hand with current methods of communicating changes to complex ecosystems in a manner that is accessible to all stakeholders. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex environmental challenges ranging from climate change and global warming to land use change require clear and compelling science communication. For example, diffuse sources of pollution like atmospheric emissions and subsequent deposition or groundwater contamination are difficult subjects to envision. You will learn from experienced and talented  science communicators how to generate compelling graphics and visualizations combined with an effective narrative structure that will serve as springboards for action within any organization.\nSocio-environmental report cards are acknowledged as THE effective tool for communicating status and trends of socio-environmental systems and engaging stakeholders. These tools are being used on a global scale to effect positive change at the local level. Report cards releases have become media events that have sweeping community reach from schools to legislatures.

But among these environmental topics, sustainably assuring  food security for the growing population is one of the most pressing issues we have to find a solution for. By 2050, 9 billion will depend on the food production supply chain providing enough and healthy food without depleting our natural resources.\nTo solve this problem, we need people to gain knowledge, do research, and explore the options. You can be a piece of the puzzle: help find a solution! Start now by gaining knowledge about food production systems, food insecurity, sustainable development goals in agriculture and livestock, and food production systems thinking.\nProfessional certificate program sustainable food security\nHow is it possible that the world currently produces enough food for everyone, but still people suffer from hunger and nutrient deficiencies? How can we produce sufficient food in an environmentally sustainable way to feed the increased world population in the future?\nThis Environmental Studies professional certificate program, developed by Wageningen University, consists of 2 courses:\nThe value of systems thinking\nLearn about systems thinking and its application to improve the environmental sustainability of food production systems. The main topics are:\r\n\nComplexity and diversity of food production systems\nPrinciples of system analysis\nEvaluation methods for the environmental impact of food production systems\nStrong and weak points of different food production systems\n\nFood Access\nLearn about the basics of food access decision-making from a multilevel perspective. The main topics are:\r\nThe basic principles of food access\nChoices influencing food access\nDilemmas at household, local, national and international levels\n\nAbout Wageningen University & Research\nAt Wageningen University and Research, we are dedicated to exploring the potential of nature to improve the quality of life. Studies and courses train (future) professionals from all over the world in sustainable food systems and help consumers make informed choices about what they eat, how it is produced and the impact of their decisions on the environment and society and public health.\nCourse structures and certificates\nThe duration of each course (or MOOC: Massive Open Online Course) is flexible: study any time and place you want. You decide how to spend your time during a course. Gain the knowledge offered in each course through dynamic modules filled with video, syllabus, and assignments for practice and grading. After successful completion of all 2 courses, you can obtain an overall certificate.",

El internet, los dispositivos m\u00c3\u00b3viles, el wifi y los nuevos sistemas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos han logrado que las relaciones de trabajo encuentren nuevos canales para compartir informaci\u00c3\u00b3n, gestionar procesos y realizar transacciones en el mercado. El uso de correos electr\u00c3\u00b3nicos y redes sociales ha hecho que la gente se encuentre cada vez m\u00c3\u00a1s cerca a pesar de la distancia.\nEl uso de las nuevas tecnolog\u00c3\u00adas ha requerido de nuevas leyes que protejan el uso de datos, tal es el caso del reglamento general de protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de datos o GDPR dise\u00c3\u00b1ado por la comisi\u00c3\u00b3n europea que brinda pautas y buenas pr\u00c3\u00a1cticas para asegurar la confidencialidad de los usuarios del internet.\nSin embargo, y a pesar de los esfuerzos por definir leyes que protejan los datos, trasladar servicios y procesos de negocios al internet puede generar vulnerabilidades que permitan accesos no deseados a los sistemas y pongan en riesgo la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n confidencial de los usuarios. Las organizaciones, administraciones p\u00c3\u00bablicas y grandes empresas alrededor del mundo sufren constantes ataques a sus sistemas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos por parte del cibercrimen con el fin de secuestrar informaci\u00c3\u00b3n amenazando con eliminar la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n o interrumpir sus servicios en sus plataformas de comunicaci\u00c3\u00b3n.

Los sistemas de informaci\u00c3\u00b3n personales se encuentran cada vez m\u00c3\u00a1s vulnerables al software malicioso que utilizan los cibercriminales.

Este es un tipo de ataques que ha causado 8.5 billones de registros de p\u00c3\u00a9rdida de informaci\u00c3\u00b3n en el 2019.\nPor tal motivo, los m\u00c3\u00a9todos de ciberseguridad se colocan como una soluci\u00c3\u00b3n muy fuerte para comprender la mentalidad de los cibercriminales y aplicar estrategias de hackeo ben\u00c3\u00a9fico en tiempo real que logren dar frente a los ataques que vulneren la seguridad inform\u00c3\u00a1tica de las organizaciones y definan medidas de seguridad efectivas que protejan sistemas operativos y bases de datos.\nEn este programa, aprender\u00c3\u00a1s los fundamentos de la ciberseguridad.

It is now available to everyone. Thousands of organizations in virtually every field are using GIS to analyze data, make maps that reveal patterns and relationships, share insights, and solve complex problems of local to global significance.\nThere is a growing need for a workforce skilled in GIS. This professional GIS certificate program will provide a comprehensive introduction to state-of-the-art methods and modern applications of GIS with the goal to prepare students for entry-level GIS jobs and undergraduate programs in geospatial sciences. Using the industry leading ArcGIS Pro GIS software, students will work with GIS datasets to support better decision making across many applications through data analysis of geographic data.\nGIS is a growing technology field with widespread applications in government agencies and private industries. The global GIS market size stood at $7.5 billion in 2019, and it is expected to reach $25.6 billion by 2030 (Source).\nThe rising investments in GIS-based infrastructure and solutions by the government sector, for military and aerospace applications, and by the private sector for real-time decision-making in industries such as construction, utilities, mining, and healthcare are the key factors driving the growth in the GIS applications.\n\"The skills I have acquired from this program give me a boost in performing my tasks as a GIS Analyst. The courses are well structured. The Professional Certificate I have obtained became the reason for me to be invited as resource speaker in a local professional assembly and GIS workshops.\"\nArnold T. Tanondong, M.Sc.\r\nJ.H.

El an\u00c3\u00a1lisis de estos datos es conocido como inteligencia de negocios o business intelligence y es fundamental para la toma de decisiones.\nEste Programa de Certificaci\u00c3\u00b3n Profesional, compuesto por dos cursos en l\u00c3\u00adnea, te ayudar\u00c3\u00a1 a comprender este contexto actual y qu\u00c3\u00a9 criterios deben tener en cuenta quienes formulan pol\u00c3\u00adticas p\u00c3\u00bablicas al momento de redactar o desarrollar leyes, regulaciones o pol\u00c3\u00adticas en materia de protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de datos y privacidad, as\u00c3\u00ad como aspectos pr\u00c3\u00a1cticos de los programas de gobernanza de datos.\nLos cursos online que hacen parte de este programa son: gobernanza de datos personales en la era digital y protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de datos personales en la era digital. Comienza a aprender sobre el manejo de los datos.\nLa protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de los datos personales ha tomado gran importancia en los \u00c3\u00baltimos a\u00c3\u00b1os. Ello se debe a que las organizaciones de todo tipo se valen de herramientas tecnol\u00c3\u00b3gicas y digitales que permiten organizar la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n, incluyendo los datos personales, para darle tratamiento de manera m\u00c3\u00a1s r\u00c3\u00a1pida, eficiente y efectiva. El avance tecnol\u00c3\u00b3gico permite a las organizaciones, gobiernos, y agentes sociales, potenciar sus capacidades de operar y lograr sus metas y objetivos.\nMientras que hace treinta a\u00c3\u00b1os una visita al supermercado apenas involucraba intercambiar informaci\u00c3\u00b3n sobre el valor de los productos para realizar el pago de los mismos, hoy por hoy existen supermercados que usan tecnolog\u00c3\u00ada digital de la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n y la comunicaci\u00c3\u00b3n para r\u00c3\u00a1pidamente identificar al comprador, identificar los productos que pone en su canasta, y sin necesidad de sacar dinero o tarjetas de cr\u00c3\u00a9dito del bolsillo, hacer el pago autom\u00c3\u00a1tico simplemente saliendo de la tienda con los productos reci\u00c3\u00a9n sacados del estante. Todo ello se logra gracias al procesamiento de informaci\u00c3\u00b3n, entre ella datos personales (identificaci\u00c3\u00b3n, cuentas bancarias, h\u00c3\u00a1bitos de compra, etc.). Lo mismo ocurre cuando hay intercambios sociales, comerciales o de simple informaci\u00c3\u00b3n en internet, a trav\u00c3\u00a9s de aplicaciones, a trav\u00c3\u00a9s de sitios web.\nEn este escenario rico en informaci\u00c3\u00b3n y especialmente en datos personales, se requieren reglas para el adecuado manejo de este tipo de informaci\u00c3\u00b3n. Esas reglas son especialmente importantes cuando la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n compartida digitalmente se refiere a datos de salud, preferencia sexual, origen racial, creencias religiosas, informaci\u00c3\u00b3n gen\u00c3\u00a9tica, n\u00c3\u00bamero telef\u00c3\u00b3nico, origen \u00c3\u00a9tnico, opiniones pol\u00c3\u00adticas, informaci\u00c3\u00b3n bancaria, entre otros datos personales. En este \u00c3\u00a1mbito, asuntos como la implementaci\u00c3\u00b3n de protocolos de manejo de informaci\u00c3\u00b3n, as\u00c3\u00ad como de medidas de seguridad para el manejo de los datos personales, son de suma importancia.\nTodos aquellos agentes de la comunidad que realicen tratamiento de datos personales, especialmente en estos tiempos altamente digitales, deben poner la protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de los datos personales como una prioridad de sus organizaciones, de sus colaboradores, de sus directivos, de sus proveedores. Los titulares de los datos personales tienen derechos que han de ser protegidos y las organizaciones deben establecer mecanismos, procesos y protocolos para ello.\nSi bien no todos los pa\u00c3\u00adses tienen las mismas reglas, existen principios orientadores, aproximaciones similares, y otras diametralmente diferentes. Es importante que se conozcan los diferentes enfoques frente a la privacidad y los datos personales, ya que el mundo digital involucra muchas veces la interacci\u00c3\u00b3n con agentes de otros pa\u00c3\u00adses y sujetos a otras jurisdicciones.\nEste Programa de Certificaci\u00c3\u00b3n Profesional, compuesto por dos cursos en l\u00c3\u00adnea, te ayudar\u00c3\u00a1 a comprender este contexto actual y qu\u00c3\u00a9 criterios deben tener en cuenta quienes formulan pol\u00c3\u00adticas p\u00c3\u00bablicas al momento de redactar o desarrollar leyes, regulaciones o pol\u00c3\u00adticas en materia de protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de datos y privacidad, as\u00c3\u00ad como aspectos pr\u00c3\u00a1cticos de los programas de gobernanza de datos.\r\nLos cursos online que hacen parte de este programa son: gobernanza de datos personales en la era digital y protecci\u00c3\u00b3n de datos personales en la era digital.

        "description": "Addressing global challenges such as climate change, the decline of biodiversity and the violation of human rights is high on the agenda of international organizations, universities, non-governmental organizations and companies and stands at the core of the concept of sustainable development.  The key importance of sustainable development has also been recognized in the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which also underlines the tradeoffs between global sustainability goals. Many global governance instruments have been developed and aim to tackle these challenges. In particular, international trade plays an important role both as perpetrator of global sustainability challenges and as a tool to address them.\nThis program provides an in-depth introduction into the Sustainable Development Goals and the key institutions established to address global sustainability challenges. Through 3 courses, you will learn what the key sustainability challenges are, how they can be addressed, which trade-offs exist in addressing sustainability challenges, which challenges emerge with the implementation of policies to address sustainability challenges and how to analyze the effectiveness of the many global governance instruments that are available to tackle global challenges, with a specific focus on international trade policy instruments.\nYou will acquire knowledge on these topics, get access to cutting edge reports and other sources such as webinars and hear from leading academics and practitioners. In total, the professional certificate gathers the insights from more than 25 experts. Academic experts come from a wide range of disciplines relevant to addressing sustainability challenges including law, political science, economics and bio-engineering. You will also learn from practitioners and policy-makers from the local to the global level.\nThe program is designed to empower critical and results-driven thinking that can be applied in the different types of organizations.\nThis professional certificate will give you a leading edge if you want to pursue a career in sustainable development either as a civil servant or policy advisor in national and international organizations, a campaigner for an NGO, a researcher engaged in sustainability research for a think tank or university or a business professional in the area of corporate social responsibility.\nThe program was developed by the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies, a leading international and interdisciplinary research centre of the University of Leuven. The Centre conducts fundamental academic research but is also involved in sustainability research for a wide range of institutions including UN agencies, European Union institutions, national governments and private actors. It brings together renowned faculty and shares its knowledge through different channels including academic papers, webinars, roundtables and conferences.",

As distributed work continues to rise in popularity, there are already signs that these changes may lead to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew normal\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Facebook, Twitter and Shopify are among several companies who are moving the majority of their workforces online, permanently.\nWorking remotely has many benefits, including increased employee productivity and satisfaction. Yet, it is not without its challenges: many individuals and organizations struggle to effectively adapt their businesses and interactions with others online.\nHuman-centered design (HCD) principles are used by successful companies worldwide to transform thinking and inspire innovation. This professional certificate program teaches you how to apply HCD strategies to reinvent your work reality, and support others who are doing the same.\nEach module includes inspiring video conversations with guest speakers from a range of industries, including physiotherapy, game design, ecommerce, health and communications, and more. Uncover how these people have transformed their work from a distance, and apply strategies and best practices gleaned from these case studies to reimagine your own work at a distance.\nGain a toolkit of visual maps based on design processes used by the digital media, game, arts, medical, and emerging technology sectors. And reflect, adapt and prototype actionable solutions to solve a variety of remote work challenges.\nThis professional certificate program is taught by UBC Professor Patrick Pennefather, a strategic design expert who has taught human-centered design and scalable MVP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (minimum viable prototypes) strategies to a range of institutions, nonprofits and corporations over the past 15 years.",

        "description": "Learn the fundamentals of Human Computer Interaction in this four-course certificate.\nThis course begins with an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction as a whole and where it sits in the context of related and similar fields like Human Factors Engineering and User Experience Design. Here, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn just enough of the history of HCI to get started having real conversations about the field.\nThen, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn the fundamental design principles of human-computer interaction. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start with the fundamental feedback cycle that underlies all interactions between users and interfaces. With that in mind, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll then learn the design principles developed by visionaries in the field like Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood. From there, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll move into more advanced theories of HCI, including situated action and distributed cognition, then conclude by looking at how interface design can impact social change.\nAfter you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned the fundamental principles and theories of HCI, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll move onto the design life cycle. The design life cycle covers how you iteratively gather requirements, brainstorm alternatives, prototype interfaces, and gather user feedback quickly to make fast progress in designing and improving user interfaces. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover the basics of how to develop a good survey, conduct an informative interview, and control for bias throughout your needfinding processes. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll then learn about running effective brainstorming sessions, and then prototyping at the just-right level of fidelity for your current confidence in your designs. Finally, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn how to evaluate those prototypes with real users, gathering their feedback for a new run through the design life cycle.\nAfter that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll briefly look at the current state of human-computer interaction, focusing on three areas: technologies like virtual and augmented reality, ideas like gesture- or touch-based interaction, and application areas like healthcare and security. In this exploration, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll rely heavily on cutting-edge papers and publications from the ever-changing field of HCI.\nThen finally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll recap the entire course contents, and tell you what to do next to further your HCI education: whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuing a Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or PhD in the field, taking follow-up MOOCs, or beginning your own HCI research career.\nThe material in this course is borrowed from Georgia Tech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction, part of its online Master of Science in Computer Science program. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll watch the exact same lectures as students in the for-credit program.",

If the current approach to urbanization does not change, most of these people will live in sub-standard conditions, lacking opportunities for income generation, occupying inadequate housing and without sustainable livelihoods. How can this gloomy scenario be avoided?\nUrban design and architecture can contribute with new methods and approaches to promote the construction of more inclusive and sustainable cities.\nIn this program you will take part in a cross-disciplinary conversation that looks into the state of cities in the Global North and Global South.

The introductory course will help you identify what are the main urban challenges in your local environment and debate possible innovative solutions for it. The other two courses deal in greater depth with two fundamental challenges related to SDG 11: affordable housing and inequality.\nIn each course, you will engage in a series of modules that explore a combination of innovative research with first-hand empirical material collected in cities and urban areas visited by the course team. These modules will help you grasp how housing and urban design offer tools and instruments to tackle one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main challenges: sustainable urbanization for a more sustainable and resilient urban future.\nCurrently ranked as the World #2 School of Architecture (QS World University Rankings 2020), the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft has well-merited its reputation as a world leader in design pedagogy and innovation. This program brings together TU Delft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expert researchers and instructors who have been exploring the relationship between design and societal challenges from different planning and design perspectives.

It provides a brief history of Java and presents the foundations of what set it apart from the programming languages (procedural and object-oriented) that existed at the time of its creation. Students will then learn the basics of Java syntax and explore writing interactive programs that incorporate concepts and constructs like: primitive data types, classes, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, arrays, console input and output, methods, and reuse.\nFollowing this introduction, students will begin hands-on learning about object-oriented programming.  They'll write their own custom classes that represent real-world concepts and objects and learn how to organize different (built-in and custom) classes into a programming solution.\nStudents will then extend their understanding of reusability with an introduction to inheritance and explore topics like parent-child class (or subclass-super-class) relationships, abstract classes, and UML. \nNext, students will learn about interfaces and polymorphism.  Intertwined in that discussion is a mini-lesson on the kinds of algorithms that are often used to process data in programs and how one might use them in an OOP context. Students will also learn the basics of evaluating algorithms based on the concept of runtime complexity.  Such a skill can ultimately make them better programmers.\nAlong those lines, students will improve their approach to handling runtime errors by learning about exceptions.  They will apply the construct in multiple contexts, including file input and output.\nThe course series concludes by presenting the fundamentals of a few advanced topics, namely: data structures (primarily lists), recursion, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with JavaFX, anonymous inner classes, and lambda expressions.",

This Professional Certificate program will introduce you to the profession of social work. This program examines the historical development of social work and focuses on the knowledge, values, and skills that characterize the social worker. It provides an orientation to the context for social work, including the diversity of human needs, human services, social policy, and legislation. Services, programs, and career opportunities nationally are discussed throughout.\nThe primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and to help meet the basic human needs of all people, with particular attention to the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. A social worker should not only work with the client to help them through the injustice or to adapt to the injustice but to work towards changing that injustice. Learners will be introduced to the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics and how to apply and utilize the code to navigate ethical dilemmas and utilize the code in decision-making processes.\nCreated by a Clinical Professor of Social Work with over 20 years of experience, this certificate program will highlight the positive difference social workers can make in the lives of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities around the world.",

        "description": "When stroke occurs, the most frequent question asked by a survivor was whether he/she could recover. The post-stroke rehabilitation journey may take months to years, and even a lifetime. Therefore, every stroke survivor needs to adapt into the new normal to regain and more often to relearn certain body functions and skills.\nWhat is the cause of stroke? What factors determine the location and severity of brain damage caused by stroke? How a life could be saved during a stroke event? Whether damage and recovery are all by chance? Are there any factors determining how long it takes for recovery? Would there be full recovery?\nOptimal outcomes of recovery rely on the collaboration between the survivor and the interdisciplinary stroke team. Individual healthcare professionals play different roles and approaches at different stages of the recovery journey. Independent disciplines are working dependently and cohesively to design the rehabilitation program tailored for every individual survivor. Quality stroke care skills of individual professionals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 can be sharpen by understanding how knowledge is being applied by different healthcare disciplines, which may promote the successful recovery of a stroke patient. Knowledge gained from this professional certificate may also help your loved ones if you have partners, friends or family members who are suffering from stroke. Regardless if you are a caregiver or stroke survivor, this Professional Certificate Program is for you.\nPS: Program contents may stimulate ideas on how stroke patients can continue with home rehabilitations even when hospital services are shutdown during pandemics, such as the COVID-19.",

It provides a framework to forecast the expected trend in the market.\nTools of technical analysis can be applied in any time frame. This makes them useful for day traders, individual investors managing retirement accounts or analysts preparing detailed reports that include opinions on the likelihood of gains in a market.\nBecause the analysis is based solely on market data, technical analysis can be applied to individual stocks, broad market indexes, futures contracts, cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange or any other market.\nThe information in these courses can be used to develop a standalone trading methodology. It can also be used as a supplement to fundamental analysis, using fundamentals to determine what to buy or sell while using technicals to determine when to make the trades. In this way, technical analysis helps an analyst add value to their reports.\nFundamentals of Technical Analysis focuses on defining the tools of technical analysis including chart patterns and indicators. Quantitative Technical Analysis provides a strategy for incorporating the tools into an algorithmic format that can be automated or applied manually in a disciplined manner.\nCombined, the courses provide all the information needed to become a trader in any market around the world or an analyst specializing in technical reports of financial markets.\nThis professional certificate is comprised of the following courses:\r\n\nC01: Fundamentals of Technical Analysis\nC02: Quantitative Technical Analysis\n\n\nFree Preview!

As competitors move fast and consumer demands evolve faster than ever before, the ability and willingness to be agile is critical but not sufficient.\nOrganizations need an enterprise capability to constantly define their purpose (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and focus (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u009d) at all levels to maximize value creation and delivery.\nProduct management practices build unprecedented discipline during the course of building a successful product. Teams constantly evaluate who they are building for, what they should build, and why they should build it. Developing a clear understanding of these aspects (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d) prior to undertaking the expensive build process ensures two critical outcomes - that an organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited resources are constantly aligned to delivering highest value, and\r\nthe output aligns with what the customers are looking for, thereby ensuring product success.\nWe start with building a deep understanding of the customer focusing on a single product throughout its product life cycle in the first course. We build up on this approach by introducing related product offerings. This allows for managers to envision their programs and teams working in a diverse product portfolio using Lean principles.\nBuilding on that understanding of the product portfolio, we pursue an understanding of what a Product Enterprise is, why it makes sense to build one and how to get there. This second course lays the conceptual groundwork that enables achieving the vision of a customer-centric value creation business model centered around lean principles.\nFinally, the capstone course lays out the details of building out a scaled product enterprise that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer-centric, and explores alignment of organizational support functions with a scaled product framework that lays the pathway for a sustainable value maximizing enterprise at scale.\nIn summary, this certificate will help you build a product enterprise through lean product portfolio management. It will build up on core lean principles to help create scalable internal alignment to uncover and deliver highest value opportunities on a continuous basis.",

Estas competencias siempre han estado incluidas en el Top10 de las competencias necesarias para trabajar en entornos presenciales y est\u00c3\u00a1n entre las m\u00c3\u00a1s frecuentes en las demandas de empleo.\nTodas las organizaciones se enfrentan a un entorno de trabajo disruptivo donde est\u00c3\u00a1n emergiendo nuevos paradigmas que afectan a la gesti\u00c3\u00b3n de las personas y aun no somos capaces de saber cu\u00c3\u00a1l de ellos permanecer\u00c3\u00a1. Sin embargo, hay unanimidad en asumir que el futuro inmediato ser\u00c3\u00a1 m\u00c3\u00a1s digital que el presente que estamos viviendo.\nEn entornos remotos el trabajar en equipo, liderar y comunicar son, si cabe, m\u00c3\u00a1s esenciales y, adem\u00c3\u00a1s, m\u00c3\u00a1s complejas de desempe\u00c3\u00b1ar. Por ello, queremos ayudar a preparar a las personas que ocupan puestos de mando o que participan en equipos de trabajo a adaptar estas tres competencias a contextos de trabajo m\u00c3\u00a1s digitales.\nPor un lado, no existe una experiencia asentada en la selecci\u00c3\u00b3n y activaci\u00c3\u00b3n de los comportamientos adaptados al entorno remoto, y por otro, tampoco es habitual encontrar cursos espec\u00c3\u00adficos donde se refuercen estos nuevos comportamientos. Debemos tener presente que no siempre se manifiestan igual que en entornos presenciales y hay que activar unos recursos personales diferentes. Por ejemplo, en entornos virtuales la comunicaci\u00c3\u00b3n escrita o visual juega un papel m\u00c3\u00a1s importante en relaci\u00c3\u00b3n a la verbal; las instrucciones se interpretan de forma totalmente diferente si no se dan con precisi\u00c3\u00b3n; y la tendencia a sentirse aislado e independiente debe combatirse con herramientas y habilidades que permitan recordar que seguimos siendo un equipo.\nPor otro lado, la riqueza de los canales remotos, a pesar de los avances, no est\u00c3\u00a1 al nivel de la presencialidad y, adem\u00c3\u00a1s, requiere de ciertas habilidades de interacci\u00c3\u00b3n con la tecnolog\u00c3\u00ada para mostrar la cercan\u00c3\u00ada que estas tres competencias requieren, a pesar de la distancia f\u00c3\u00adsica entre los participantes.\r\nConstruiremos el aprendizaje mediante recursos digitales, ejemplos de experiencias, auto-diagn\u00c3\u00b3sticos de las personas inscritas y feedback de pares para completar una informaci\u00c3\u00b3n 360\u00c2\u00ba que permita trazar un plan de acci\u00c3\u00b3n de gesti\u00c3\u00b3n de cada una de las competencias.",

It focuses on explaining many macroeconomic phenomena that we either observed first hand or heard indirectly from the media. The program considers long-term economic growth in developed and developing economies. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also learn why a national (or global) economy experiences short-term cycles in activity (e.g., recessions and recoveries) around its long-term growth trend.\nThe behaviour of an economy as a whole is often broadly predictable, but sometimes it can suddenly change due to a range of unpredictable factors such as regional conflicts, financial crises and health emergencies. This program explains what central banks and governments can do to try to smooth these fluctuations and to lift the living standard. Theories or \u00e2\u0080\u0098models\u00e2\u0080\u0099 widely used by governments, central banks and the private sector to conduct macroeconomic analyses are explained intuitively as well as discussed critically. The behaviour of the financial system, including the banking system and asset markets, is also considered, especially in the light of financial crises.\nThe three courses are based but extended on an introductory macroeconomics course taught on campus at The University of Queensland. A focus is placed on core economic principles that are immediately applicable rather than formal mathematical theorisation. A distinctive feature of these courses is their strong emphasis on the international aspect of macroeconomics. Recent global economic and non-economic events have highlighted the importance of understanding the interconnection between the domestic and the international economy.\nThis program is for everyone, whether you are studying at university, a career professional interested in expanding your economic knowledge, or simply curious about global economic behaviour and what influences it.",

Along the way you will learn how to apply these concepts to datasets, using the statistical software R.\nThis program also provides an introduction to probability theory. You will encounter discrete and continuous random variables and learn in which situations they appear, what their properties are and how they interact.

        "description": "The program teaches the principles and practice of MBSE - Model-Based Systems Engineering, using Object-Process Methodology - OPM. Conceptual modeling of a system's requirements, concept, and architecture is a first, critical stage in a successful process of developing any system. Recognized as ISO 19450, OPM is founded on a simple, universal ontology of objects and processes that transform them. It is a compact graphical and textual modeling language for conceptual modeling of complex systems of all kinds.\nSince in OPM objects and processes can be modeled as physical or informatical, it is ideal for modeling cyber-physical systems (CPSs), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, where the digital twin is prevalent, and fusing hardware and software is imperative.\nThe program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying philosophy and guideline are that systems and software engineering are complementary, and a systems engineer must know the principles of both to thrive in the modern Industry 4.0 environment. OPM is key to achieving this engineering education objective because it is geared to easily and naturally specify software-intensive socio-technical systems, which also involve humans in the loop. Unlike SysML, which has nine kinds of diagrams, OPM has just one. Moreover, OPM represents the model in both graphics and natural language text, catering to the human dual channel processing and facilitating model comprehension.\nThe program blends and balances systems science and engineering theory with practical modeling using OPCloud - OPM Cloud-based modeling environment, which is embedded in edX. The methodology part of OPM entails how to approach the problem of modeling, architecting, and designing new systems, as well as analyzing existing ones. You will learn how to define and model the problem at hand, the function of the system aimed to solve the problem, the stakeholders, the beneficiary group, and the benefit they are expected to gain. Turning to a detailed specification of the solution system, product, or service, things get more complex. During the program, you will learn the process of system design and development using MBSE with OPM. The course content was produced to be informative and entertaining. You will model various real-life systems in OPM \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mainly technological, but also social and natural. Learning is made interactive through diverse, engaging exercises and interaction with OPCloud with real-time detailed feedback. \nThe course \"MBSE 102 - Model-based Systems Engineering: Advanced Approaches with OPM\" is a continuation for MBSE 101.\r\nTherefore, learners must take MBSE 101 before taking MBSE 102, since it is a prerequisite.\r\nThe new run for MBSE 101 will start on October 27th, 2019. \n",

They are all complex mechanical systems composed of rigid bodies moving through articulated joints and submitted to forces and torques. Their study is the basis of the scientific field called multibody dynamics.\nWhether you are an engineer designing a vehicle, a technician building a robot or setting up a prothesis, or a physiotherapist studying a human body motion, you might need to model and analyze the behavior of such multibody systems. You will learn that skill through this program.\nAlthough an advanced program, your learning will be very progressive. It starts from the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics and then proposes to solve everyday applications of increasing complexity, using the free symbolic software Robotran (www.robotran.be) that generates the nonlinear equations in C, Python or MATLAB language.\nThe advantage of the symbolic generation is to be able to deal with realistic three-dimensional applications without having to generate the nonlinear equations of motion yourself, by hand or with a commercial numerical software.\nThe program successively covers the following topics:\r\n\nRecall and notations of Newtonian mechanics \nPrinciples of the multibody formalism\nIntroduction to symbolic modeling (with Robotran)\nNumerical simulation of simple cases\nModeling of external and internal forces\nTreatment of kinematic constraints\nAnalysis techniques: direct/inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, time integration, equilibrium and modal analysis.\n\nBoth courses combine videos, exercises, projects, continuous assessment and final exams so that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gain maximum practice and deep learning in multibody system dynamics.",

This preview course also offers an opportunity to earn an edX certificate for $49.\nTaught by instructors with decades of experience on Wall Street, the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) Professional Certificate program is a fast paced, comprehensive yet detailed introduction to the U.S. mortgage-backed securities market.\nThe program covers the basics of terminology and features of individual mortgage contracts all the way through to the structure and investment characteristics of exotic instruments such as PAC bond tranches and reverse mortgage securitization.\nAlong the way, the program will address aspects of the MBS market ranging from the creation of the basic building blocks (mortgage origination and types of mortgages), the process of turning them into investment instruments (asset securitization) and how in certain instances the cash distributions are structured to create a variety of securities from a single collateral pool (types of tranches of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 CMOs).\nThe majority of the program will focus on the largest segment of the market, agency (FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA) residential mortgage backed securities, both pass-through securities and CMOs. However, the other market sectors (agency multi-family, non-agency CMOs and commercial mortgage-backed securities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 CMBS) will be addressed in some detail.\nThe coverage of each type of security will address: the most frequently encountered instrument in each category as well as common variations, the type of collateral that provide the cash flows for distribution to investors, and the structure of cash disbursements. The primary themes in the discussion of each security is the consequence of all those forgoing elements with respect to the primary types of risk investors face and the way in which those elements impact expected return.\nAugmenting the discussion of the securities will be an introduction to the pricing conventions (including PSA and CPR speeds) and analytics (OAS analysis) as well as market-related issues such as TBA trading and dollar rolls.\nNOTE: Completing all 2 parts and then taking the Professional Certificate Examination is MANDATORY to achieve both the NYIF Certificate of Mastery and the edX Professional Certificate in Mortgage Backed Securities.

Even if you have a team of full stack developers, they are faced with the fact that infrastructure needs to be established before the first line of hand-coding can be written. Now what about low-code applications vs traditional-coding?  (Building apps using Drag-and Drop tools or excel being examples)\nTo respond to this challenge, Low Code/No Code (LC/NC)platforms are selected to meet a business need.  However, during the platform selection process, the platform's go to market team promises their platform will solve all of your business problems, and while this may be true it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t without effort, and it is rarely seamless.  As the business representative to the platform, it is your duty to understand how this system will impact your business, where the gaps are and if you will be able to adjust your business processes to meet the business processes of the platform selected.  Understanding your business is half of the challenge, understanding your platform is just as important.\nDuring this course the student will go through a full Low Code/No Code platform lifecycle.  Learners will get an understanding of how to lead Citizen Developers (CD) and learn how to deploy solutions that will deliver success.  This 3-course program has modules that will guide students through the workflow and processes of building an enterprise solution in a Low Code/No Code environment with the aid of templates.  By the end, students will have done some low-code app development without the need of prior coding experience or programming language.

Companies have awoken to the desperate need for product managers to create products that customers love, that integrate design, functionality, and business solutions. This is a one of kind product management certification that covers the skill sets for the entire product lifecycle.\nWe start with the fundamentals of product management and why this role is so coveted as a launch pad for future CEOs and startup founders. By exploring the roles and responsibilities of being a product manager, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll identify its relationship to stakeholders external and internal, including customers, engineering, legal, finance, marketing, and customer service.\nAs a product manager you have to own the results of your product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success by tackling risks early and setting up your teams for success. This is why we immediately move on to discussing product-market fit, with a detailed examination of target customers, customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underserved needs, value propositions, feature sets, and user experiences.\nDesigning the customer and user experience is essential to creating great products today. Gone is the old paradigm of \u00e2\u0080\u009cform follows function\u00e2\u0080\u009d model of design. The process must be iterative and follow the best product design and development processes. This essential product management course explains key design thinking principles around personas, story mapping, and prototyping. Product managers need to know and appreciate product designer tools and processes.  By combining these principles with good scrum processes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn to create great products that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sacrifice design for functionality or feasibility.\nAgile systems engineering ensures great products truly excel over time in all three areas of design, functionality, and technical feasibility. Agile systems engineering uses tools such as rapid prototyping, open set architectures, and platform design. By using an agile methodology not just for business and design, you'll innovate and collaborate better, manage costly technical debt, and validate your product ideas with data science and innovation metrics.\nFinally, you cannot lead products without core skills in leadership and influence. Product managers are masters at internal sales, team building, delegation, and empowerment. They also know that great product management careers are not built alone. From envisioning a product strategy to correctly portraying the product roadmap, the process must be inclusive, interactive, and motivating.

        "description": "Setting a clear vision is essential for leaders in any organization, as it helps to guide decision-making and inspires employees and stakeholders to work towards common goals. Strategic planning leaders struggle with envisioning the future and may not have the skills to effectively communicate their vision. Senior leadership must then create action plans that elevate the strategic planning document so that all stakeholders are aligned. Strategy development matters only as much as it can be successfully executed. If you are considering a strategic planning process, you must be conscious of the interface between vision and execution.\nThe business environment is changing quickly as new technologies, risks and opportunities present themselves. Companies without strategic foresight and long-term vision capabilities will remain in reactive modes. Strategy formulation is not enough to withstand shocks. Strategists must commit time for reflective thinking and away from the day to day in order to scan the external environment and discover what the convergence of trends, demographics threats, and opportunities means for successful strategic planning.\nResearch shows that less than 10% of leaders consider themselves to be visionary and few think long-term about all stakeholders and their needs. This is a problem, as employees, product management teams, project managers and other stakeholders want to be part of a company with bold, clear strategic goals and strategic objectives that are ignited by a clearly described future state. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy movement\u00e2\u0080\u009d linked to crafting purpose and organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission statements is now being supplanted by the emerging \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere movement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This movement goes beyond brainstorming towards declaring the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig ideas\u00e2\u0080\u009d tied to long term goals that will inspire stakeholders and create a competitive advantage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are we going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an organization is the primal question posed by employees that CEOs and product managers must smartly address. This program will show you how.\nFurthermore, the rise of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investors and stakeholders has increased the pressure on companies to take a longer-term view and link their vision to sustainable measures that delight a broad set of stakeholders.\nAs leaders pivot from the vision towards strategy execution, they are then met with either resistance or lift as organizational architecture and economics bring realism against the aspiration. Operational plans must confront and align their 4 pillars that will enable leaders to execute the organizations goals or wind up frustrated by the inertia that they create. The 4-pillar methodology delivers a strategic framework that makes the linkage between:\r\n\nPerformance measurement and goal setting (OKRs or KPIs)\nEstablishing team structures, organization charts and empowerment\nRewards, punishments and incentives, and\nCorporate culture (norms, values, behaviors and assumptions).\n\n\nOne example of a leader who successfully applied this strategic framework is CEO Satya Nadella of Microsoft. By focusing on these four pillars, he was able to transform the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission and pursue new opportunities that led Microsoft to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Too often leaders simply change an element of culture or a piece of performance evaluation and there is a breakdown as they must look at all four pillars simultaneously. Nadella reset Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model and strategy as he optimized the four pillars against a strategy map that helped all employees know what mattered the most. Once in place, Microsoft began to unleash an effective product strategy chasing new time frames that routinely encourages product plans that are bold with outstanding user experiences.\nThe program will also dissect cases like Wells Fargo where the business strategy and 4 pillars were misaligned and drove young employees to promote opening accounts with disastrous results for consumers and shareholders.\nThis two-part course will make the connection between a long-term vision and strategic planning driven by the CEO and C-suite and the translation down to product design teams and project managers who live in day-to-day execution. By reinforcing mechanisms that drive constructive behaviors, the course will help leaders turn their big ideas into practical, tangible products. In doing so, it will make the power of vision more accessible and help leaders to create value for all stakeholders. By focusing on long-term vision (and exploring cathedral and multi-generational thinking) and clearly communicating it through concrete language, imagery, initiatives and storytelling, CEOs and founders as well as the product managers can set their organization apart and unite their people towards a common, achievable future. This course will teach how your business plan and business goals can be elevated by vision (big ideas) and executed through the proper alignment and reinforcement mechanisms within the 4 pillars.",

Any individual that masters it will not only become more efficient in their own life but will also be able to help others with their own difficulties, get better at resolving conflict, problem solving, decision-making and managing interpersonal conflicts.\nIn addition, conflict management is an essential skill to master in professional environments. Indeed, conflict is a most prevalent experience in the workplace as about one-third of employees report experiencing disagreements, instances of conflict or ongoing difficult relationships over a period of 12 months. As a matter of fact, conflict is highly detrimental to organizational functioning as it decreases employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 motivation, increases stress, anxiety, and depression, and is detrimental to the finances of companies, either through an increase in sick leave or via lawsuit costs.\nFinally, conflict management skills are of tremendous importance in the virtual world. Indeed, by their very nature (e.g. online disinhibition, anonymity and text-only communication) virtual environments constitute places where conflicts are most likely to arise and in which interpersonal and inter-team collaboration attempts face unique challenges due to the fact that members of virtual collaborations work across cultural, geographical and time boundaries.\nThis conflict management certification encompasses all psychological aspects of conflict and conflict management, both for internal and external stakeholders. Although work contexts will be tackled throughout the three courses, our approach will be centered on everyday life conflict skills.\nIn each course, particular sections will be devoted to virtual environments. In the first course, we will introduce the phenomenology of conflict and describe how virtual environments influence the presence and escalation of conflicts. In the second course, we will describe negotiation strategies, and we will assess how virtual environments shape the way negotiation strategies are enacted and how effective they are.

The era that quantum computing promises to bring about is often likened to the era initiated by the classical computer. In such a \"quantum\" information era, quantum computers will be complemented by the quantum internet, which will allow for the transmission of quantum information over long distances. This capability would support many revolutionary applications, such as unhackable communication, clock synchronization and secure access to quantum computers in the cloud.\nBut how do quantum computers and quantum internet work? What scientific principles are behind them? What is the hardware that is being researched? What kind of software and protocols are needed for quantum computing and quantum internet? Which disciplines of science and engineering are required to develop these?\nThe aim of this program is to help you get up to speed with the present progresses in the transition to a quantum information era. After a quick review of some of the basic concepts that will enable you understanding the operating principles of quantum computation and quantum internet, the program will begin with an extensive discussion on some of the different ways qubits can be built.\nMoreover, we will discuss how a large-scale quantum processor could be built using these qubits. Some of the topics that we cover are micro-architectures, compilers, and quantum programming languages. You will also explore some of the basics of quantum error-correction, an essential procedure that allows us to combat errors that arise during computations using delicate qubits.\nThe program then concludes with a discussion on the quantum internet: what is it? How can it be built? Why is it useful?\nThe program is a journey of discovery, so we encourage you to bring your own experiences, insights and thoughts via the forum!",

Then imagine that baby transformed your team to be more joyful, humorous, creative, resilient, and effective, all while working remotely.\nYou are about to enroll in that baby.\nNaomi Bagdonas and Connor Diemand-Yauman are leading experts in organizational leadership and culture. They've coached celebrities and fortune 500 executives, taught at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, and founded and led multiple organizations. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve teamed up with comedic minds from The Onion, Funny Or Die, and Comedy Central to create a fun, interactive learning experience to empower you to show up more authentically, effectively, and joyfully at work and life.\nYou might be wondering: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould I really be prioritizing a course about humor? Also, was it just me, or did that baby metaphor kind of fall apart at the end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTo answer your first question: humor is what makes all the other stuff your team has to do tolerable. In this brave new world of work, when we rarely see our team members in person \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or from the pajama bottoms down \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it's harder than ever to foster connection, joy, and well-being in our remote teams. All the while, behavioral science suggests that creating a company culture of humor and levity is the quickest path to nurturing these things.\nTo answer your second question: Yes. Just roll with it.\nThis program is designed for individuals who want to be more energized, joyful, and effective at work and for remote teams that want to feel more connected, creative, and resilient through the most challenging times. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also for anyone who wants fewer one-hour meetings that feel like three-hour meetings with only ten minutes of useful work.\nYou shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to choose between catching up on your favorite comedy show and learning techniques for being happier and better at your job. Now you can kill two birds (the Boredom Hawk and the Inefficiency Vulture, to be specific) with one online learning experience.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to be on this journey with you.",

This professional certificate program, developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a project of the Linux Foundation, is geared towards software developers, DevOps professionals, software engineers, web application developers, and others interested in learning how to develop secure software, focusing on practical steps that can be taken, even with limited resources to improve information security. The program enables software developers to create and maintain systems that are much harder to successfully attack, reduce the damage when attacks are successful, and speed the response so that any latent vulnerabilities can be rapidly repaired. The best practices covered in the course apply to all software developers, and it  includes information especially useful to those who use or develop open source software.\nThe program discusses risks and requirements, design principles, and evaluating code (such as packages) for reuse. It then focuses on key implementation issues: input validation (such as why allowlists and not denylists should be used), processing data securely, calling out to other programs, sending output, cryptography, error handling, and incident response. This is followed by a discussion on various kinds of verification issues, including tests, including security testing and penetration testing, and security tools. It ends with a discussion on deployment and handling vulnerability reports.\nThe training courses included in this program focus on practical steps that you (as a developer) can take to counter most common kinds of attacks. It does not focus on how to attack systems, how attacks work, or longer-term research.\nModern software development depends on open source software, with open source now being pervasive in data centers, consumer devices, and services. It is important that those responsible for cybersecurity are able to understand and verify the security of the open source chain of contributors and dependencies. Thanks to the involvement of OpenSSF, a cross-industry collaboration that brings together leaders to improve the security of open source software by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practices, this program provides specific tips on how to use and develop open source securely.",

In software, we will focus on different types of caches, that are one of the main targets in software-based side-channel attacks.\nOn the hardware side, we will mount power analysis attacks on the cryptographic algorithms RSA and AES. We will see that simple power analysis attacks and differential power analysis attacks are powerful enough to obtain fine-grained information such as cryptographic keys, user input, or secrets of the operating system. This skill set and knowledge will give you the ability to spot these side channels in hardware and software projects. We will then cover countermeasures and mitigation strategies that allow you to develop side-channel-resilient hardware and software and protect your security-critical applications and sensitive information.\nIn both courses, you will practically apply the acquired skills in simple exercises based on measurements you perform on your own computer or measurements we obtained from physical devices, that we provide to you.

        "description": "In this program, you will learn about more advanced attacks in the space of side-channel security: transient-execution attacks and fault attacks. In the first course. we will focus on transient execution (and speculative execution) and how it can introduce data (not meta-data!) leakage. We will use side channels to exfiltrate data and transmit it to an attacker-controlled application. We will learn about the most prominent of transient-execution attacks: Meltdown, Spectre, Foreshadow, and ZombieLoad. These attacks are so powerful that they can leak arbitrary secret data, including cryptographic keys, all without physical access. In a set of small exercises, you will implement some of these attacks. You will understand the connection between these attacks and side-channel attacks. You will gain deep understanding of the microarchitecture of modern processors, out-of-order execution pipelines, transient-execution attacks and potential mitigations against them.\nIn the second course, we will then focus more on fault attacks, in particular Rowhammer and Plundervolt. These attacks go beyond leaking information but instead we will manipulate data. These fault injection mechanisms are triggered purely from software and allows us to manipulate control flow, secret keys, and system security mechanisms, to fully subvert systems and bring them under our control. You will understand how these attacks can be mounted, and how they can be mitigated to allow you to develop hardware and software resilient to transient-execution and fault attacks. As an advanced topic in this block, we will also mount software-based differential power analysis attacks (DPA), following a similar methodology as for the physical side-channel attacks, leaking cryptographic keys. Again we will disucss what the countermeasures against these attacks are.\nIn both courses, you will practically apply the acquired skills in simple exercises based on measurements you perform on your own computer or measurements we  obtained from physical devices, that we provide to you.

It's important for social workers to understand how to work effectively with individuals, families and communities that have experienced trauma both historically and currently.\nSocial workers and helpers have an ethical responsibility to practice self-awareness, to explore how their own historical or current experiences impact their worldview and behavior. It is also essential to learn about, cultivate, and practice self-care as we do good work with others to ensure that we do no harm to ourselves or those we help. The concept of wellness is weaved throughout these courses and is looked at as a life-long journey that we are all on, both individually and collectively. Wellness is about health, healing, growth, reflection, connection, relationships, awareness, practice, and much more.

The course is brought to you by faculty from Georgia Tech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top-ranked School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\nThis first half of this program (Course 1) provides an introduction to basic statistical concepts. We begin by walking through a library of probability distributions, where we motivate their uses and go over their fundamental properties. These distributions include such important folks as the Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, Poisson, uniform, exponential, and normal distributions, just to name a few. Particular attention is paid to the normal distribution, because it leads to the Central Limit Theorem (the most-important mathematical result in the universe, actually), which enables us to make probability calculations for arbitrary averages and sums of random variables.\nWe then discuss elementary descriptive statistics and estimation methods, including unbiased estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and the method of moments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you gotta love your MoM!  Finally, we describe the t, \u00cf\u00872, and F sampling distributions, which will prove to be useful in upcoming statistical applications.\nThe second half of the program (Course 2) covers two important methodologies in statistics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.  Confidence intervals are encountered in everyday life, and allow us to make probabilistic statements such as: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on the sample of observations we conducted, we are 95% sure that the unknown mean lies between A and B,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are 95% sure that Candidate Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity is 52% +/- 3%.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  We begin the course by discussing what a confidence interval is and how it is used. We then formulate and interpret confidence intervals for a variety of probability distributions and their parameters.\nHypothesis testing allows us to pose hypotheses and test their validity in a statistically rigorous way.  For instance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes a new drug result in a higher cure rate than the old drug\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs the mean tensile strength of item A greater than that of item B?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The second half the course begins by motivating hypothesis tests and how they are used.

This course centers on the role of urban development in accomplishing the SDGs, with a specific focus on SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.\nUnderstanding the future of cities is essential for comprehending the future of humanity. Scholars predict that the 21st century will witness a monumental shift in human history as a vast majority of the world's population migrates to cities, creating a planetary urbanism. This transformation impacts global living standards, economic organization, and environmental implications in the Anthropocene era.\r\nAdditionally, this course concentrates on urban growth in the global South, where most of the planet's urbanization will occur. It draws from the insights of the PEAK Urban program, a five-year collaborative effort involving researchers from China, Colombia, India, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. This program seeks to explore and address the challenges and opportunities associated with urban development in the regions experiencing significant growth.\nBy examining the interplay between urbanization and sustainable development, the course aims to promote effective strategies for achieving SDG11 and advancing sustainable cities and communities. By identifying key factors influencing urban growth and exploring best practices from different regions, participants can contribute to global efforts in building a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.

Different actors in the financial sector have started to account for sustainability issues in their daily operations. Not only regulatory pressure, but also stakeholder demands, incremental transparency and comparability of sustainability data, drive the transition of the financial sector towards sustainability. While sustainability has been gaining popularity in the investment business for several years now, it is only beginning in corporate finance. But since corporations play an essential role in the sustainability transformation of our economies, it is important to understand how financing is affected by sustainability considerations and how sustainability can be fostered through corporate financing.\nThis program will provide you with the foundations of corporate finance, banking, and sustainability and how these fields interact. There are four sustainability action areas (exclusion, ESG integration, transition, and sustainability solutions) that are relevant in the context of corporate financing. Special attention is given to the application of these action areas in the specific financing instrument: equity, bond, and bank financing. Specific impact-oriented and innovative financing approaches will be discussed, focusing on their relevance and origin, as well as possibilities to manage and measure the impact realized. Theoretical know-how will be accompanied by case studies and practical examples, to ensure that you are equipped with relevant experience that may be applied in your work environment.\nThese applications will also help you work on capabilities beyond the scope of this program, such as the critical reflection of public information and data and the feasibility to form your own opinion.\nSpecific impact-oriented and innovative financing approaches will be discussed, focusing on their relevance and origin, as well as possibilities to manage and measure the impact realized.

        "description": "Did you know tourism, the industry of adventure and leisure, is one of the largest worldwide? It faces many challenges. Among them the responsibility to become more sustainable. In this award-winning 3 online course programme Wageningen University & Research uniquely invites you to take on a reflective approach on sustainable tourism development.\nThe societal and environmental importance of tourism has grown significantly in recent decades. Its development is closely linked to major global changes in culture, politics, technology and the environment, affecting the quality of life of all stakeholders. While continuing its focus on growth, even in light of post-COVID ambitions to restore business-as-usual, tourism seems insensitive to sustainability issues. And with climate change forming an increasing challenge to both tourism and humanity, a radical paradigm shift is truly needed.\nThese 3 sustainable tourism courses are designed to take you on an wholistic investigation of the tourism sector and will eventually lead to your very own vision of what sustainable tourism should look like. To stimulate a continuous stream of new ideas, you are invited to join a platform for ongoing discussions on sustainable tourism business.\n1. Instead of taking on tourism education\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customary approach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 growth driven, applied and hospitality management \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the first course of this programme offers an integral introduction to the complex phenomenon that is tourism, from its historical emergence to its current impact on society and the environment.\n2. In the second course of the programme you will apply argumentation skills and different social science perspectives to tourism. You will learn of a broad array of sustainable tourism organizations, such as ecotourism and voluntourism. Together with your team you will pitch a case of your own.\n3. In spite of tourism\u00e2\u0080\u0099s substantial contribution to climate change, international tourism continues to grow exponentially, with serious environmental impacts. That is why we dedicate this third course to address the mutual relationship between tourism and climate change. Study the key challenges related to mitigation and adaptation and learn to apply them to your personal position as well as your organisational situation.\nSo, are you eager to see tourism through a new lens? Join us on this unique all-round journey to bring about a much needed paradigm shift in the tourism industry. Together, we can drive sustainability in tourism. Subscribe now!",

Anyone embarking on a career in these industries, will have to be adept at:\r\n\nrecognizing the fundamental elements in existing industry processes\nanalyzing these processes in a mathematical way\nimproving these processes by redesigning them\n\nThis program offers the chance for the participant to understand the fundamental transport processes, learn how to model these processes and apply the knowledge gained from this modeling to new examples/cases.\nThe program starts by demonstrating the role of balance equations in capturing a dynamic transport process. Subsequently, macro-scale processes are analyzed and modeled using the balance equations. Examples are drawn from mass transport, heat transfer and momentum transfer. Following this, a new type of balance equation, called micro-balance, is introduced to cover the most fundamental laws of transport phenomena. The program will also include many case studies of applications of these methods in various industries, including a heat exchanger in chemical process industry, and, dissolution time of a tablet in water from the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe content taught in this program is structured in a particular way so that:\r\n\nthe physical example or principle is taught first\nit is then converted to a mathematical formulation\nthe mathematical equation is solved\nthe physical significance of the result is interpreted from the solution.\n\nThe learner will benefit because of the dual perspective of the program: learning the fundamentals as well as making practical applications.

From their work in the academia, industry and Israeli intelligence corps, the instructors of the course possess an extensive experience in the field.\nCompleting this program will teach you the necessary knowledge and skills needed to become a better and more vigilant professional in the high-tech industry. You will learn about the different ways in which computer systems can be vulnerable, as well as many useful mitigation techniques, including the most important cryptographic tools; you will take a hard look \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder the hood\u00e2\u0080\u009d of operating systems and the Internet, understand how they can be exploited and how they can be secured; and most importantly, you will understand the principles of secure computer systems and the mindsets of both attackers and defenders.",

Science and innovation have answered these threats for generations and assisted man in managing emerging pandemics.  Consequently, diseases like Smallpox and Polio have practically been eradicated. Yet others like AIDS, SARS and Zika constantly continue to remind us that nature is bigger than us and still has much in store. This has clearly been demonstrated with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has turned our lives upside down.\nThis program is divided into two courses:\nIn the first course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntroduction to Cell Biology & Viruses\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093  you will be introduced to the world of cell biology and how viruses, as the ultimate parasites, attack cells and use them to their advantage. We have specially designed video segments that will walk you through the basic workings of our cells, how DNA functions as the hard disc of the genetic heritage we received from our parents and what proteins do to keep our bodies alive and functional.\nWe will review the world of viruses and how they differ from bacteria and other infectious agents.  Specific examples of human diseases, such as Polio, Smallpox and Flu will be discussed.\r\nIn the second course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \"Immunology: Fundamentals & Applications\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will review the basics of our first line of immune defenses, the innate immune system.  Furthermore, we will study the second arm of the immune system - adaptive immunity and how highly efficient antibodies and white blood cells custom tailor precise and specific knock-out of invading viruses, while establishing memory cells to protect us against future encounters with these disease-causing agents. \nBased on the principles of immunity and cell biology we will learn how vaccines work. We will critically evaluate their pros and concerns and how this amazing innovation has saved millions of lives.\r\nThe last lesson will be dedicated to Coronaviruses and their biology. We will review the spectrum of the human associated Coronaviruses, including SARS CoV from 2002 and MERS CoV from 2012 - the previous Coronavirus pandemics. Moreover, special attention will be devoted to an in-depth focus on SARS CoV2 and why it has been so successful in infecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In conclusion, we will discuss various approaches to the treatment and protection against COVID-19 infection and understand how 30 years of scientific innovation has led to the mRNA vaccine revolution.",
