Join us for the three-course Building Serverless Applications on AWS series.\nIn the first course, Integrating AWS with the SDK, we start with the basics of AWS Identity and Access Management to understand the different forms of authentication and security when integrating AWS services. We refactor an existing application using the AWS SDK to replace storage functionality with Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon DynamoDB. Next, we investigate using compute services Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda to run our application code. In the final upgrade, we expose the application functionality as an API with Amazon API Gateway. Our experienced instructors take you on a deep dive on the workings and benefits of each service.\nIn the second course, Serverless Architectures on AWS, we get hands on with automation tools and serverless managed services. Get your projects completed faster without needing to maintain the underlying servers hosting the managed services. Treat your infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Serverless Application Model as an automated way to build the resources hosting your applications. We use AWS Amplify to rapidly add front-end hosting and AWS Cognito to add authentication to our application. With Cognito in place, we upgrade the application API to require authentication. Next, we learn to use AWS Step Functions to move a lot of the workflow coordination code out of your applications. Using serverless services, we contrast some options for building event driven architectures with Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS and Amazon EventBridge. Join our expert instructors as we dive deep on real-world use cases for each of the featured services in the course.\nIn the third and final course, Hands-on with AWS: Software Development Practices, we will provide a combination of video-based lectures, demonstrations and hands-on lab exercises to get you hands-on committing code that flows through a full Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline.",

It is composed of 3 compact courses and 15 fascinating topics.  The topics touch on Chinese philosophy, Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, Sunzi, food and cuisine, politics, strategic thinking, literature, paintings, operas, education, and the history of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural exchanges with other countries and regions.\nWhy should I enrol in the XSeries on Chinese culture offered by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University?\r\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University is a world-class research university.  In 2021, it is ranked among the top 25 and top 75 universities by the QS Asian and QS World University Rankings respectively.  One of the missions of the University is to offer high-quality MOOCs. Our online courses have received a number of international awards, including the edX Prize for Exceptional Contributions in Online Teaching and Learning (Finalist) and Best Online Courses of All Time by Class Central in 2020-21.\nHow can I advance my knowledge and career by enrolling in this program?\r\nA basic knowledge of Chinese culture is requisite for anyone who aims to advance their career in business or academic study in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.  These regions have a population of 1.4 billion (18 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population).  This XSeries program empowers businesspeople by providing them with Chinese cultural knowledge that can inform their communication and engagement with their Chinese partners.  Furthermore, students of Chinese studies who aim to further their knowledge will find new perspectives from this program.  It also helps broaden the horizons of any laypeople who may currently have little knowledge of Chinese culture.\nThanks to a unique pedagogy that cross-references across the units and courses, this XSeries fosters the learner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holistic understanding of Chinese culture.  This holistic knowledge equips the learner with skills to connect different contexts of Chinese culture meaningfully in application.\nFor instance, in the Tradition course, you learn about Confucianism in the Zhou dynasty.  In the Transformation course, you further learn about Chinese education through the private Confucian academies from the Song dynasty onwards, as well as New Confucianism in the 20th century. In the Interaction course, you discover the answer to the interesting question whether Confucius drank tea or alcohol. Likewise, in learning about Chinese thinking styles, you will be enlightened by the study of Sunzi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Art of War in the Tradition course, the elements of human character represented by the face make-up in Chinese Operas in the Transformation course, and the history of Chinese politics in the early 20th century in the Interaction course.  There are many more connections between the units of the X series.  This program is the only XSeries on Chinese culture that capitalizes on the use of powerful cross-referencing across the topics and units, with the aim to consolidate and upgrade your practical knowledge of Chinese culture.",

Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of every part of a business.\nThis \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevOps on AWS\u00e2\u0080\u009d   series teaches you how to use the combination of DevOps philosophies, practices and tools to develop, deploy, and maintain applications in the AWS Cloud. Benefits of adopting DevOps include: rapid delivery, reliability, scalability, security and improved collaboration.\nAWS provides a set of flexible services designed to enable companies to more rapidly and reliably build and deliver products using AWS and DevOps practices. These services simplify provisioning and managing infrastructure, deploying application code, automating software release processes, and monitoring your application and infrastructure performance.\nThis series has a significant hands-on component involving the AWS Free Tier in which you will explore AWS services and concepts using AWS SDKs, AWS APIs, and the AWS Console.\nThe first course introduces you to essential AWS products, services, and common solutions. The course covers the fundamental concepts of compute, database, storage, networking, monitoring and security that learners and professionals will need to know when working with AWS.\nThe second course discusses topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated. You will explore AWS Services that will help your application delivery, like AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline.\nThe third course talks about how to improve the deployment process with DevOps methodology, and also some tools that might make deployments easier, such as Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, and AWS CodeDeploy.\nFinally, the last course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance. It also covers Amazon CloudTrail and a little bit of Machine Learning for Monitoring operations.\nNo prior experience on AWS cloud is required because the first course teaches the fundamentals of AWS.",

You will also be invited to share your own theatrical interpretations and to consider how the meaning of a work of art changes depending on the time, context, and culture.\nIn Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Life and Work, learn how to read William Shakespeare's plays through his biography, Elizabethan and Jacobean history, and modern performance. Moving between the world in which Shakespeare lived and the present day, this course will introduce different kinds of literary analysis that you can use when reading Shakespeare.\nIn William Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hamlet, the ghost of the dead King of Denmark appears to his son, setting off a chain of events that culminates in the play\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notoriously bloody finale. But how would this mysterious figure have been understood in Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how people in Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and the ways that Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience.\nIn William Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Merchant of Venice, the Jewish moneylender Shylock proposes a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmerry sport\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the merchant Antonio: he will lend Antonio the money he needs if Antonio agrees to let Shylock take a pound of his flesh should he default.
